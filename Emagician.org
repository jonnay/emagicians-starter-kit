  Look, if you're here, either you're a mutant (horray!), or I have
  done something horribly wrong. (boo!).

  Frankly the defaults here should be good enough that no-one should
  need to change them.  And by good enough I mean, really basic things
  like bog-standard libraries required, package managers set up.
  Things like spaces, tabs, and all the important stuff are in their
  own file.

** Splash 

*** Show on startup:
   	- [ ] Sigil
   	- [ ] Diary
   	- [ ] Date/time
   	- [ ] Shortcut list
      - [ ] Open up Magit status buffers
      - [ ] Dired to a dir
      - [ ] Agenda
*** Warn user if there were problems on load 

*** Message info
	- After load, store messages sowmerhew
	- diff them with the existing messages and show diffs to user

** Breakage happens, lets try and make it easier to deal with.
   Snarfed this idea from https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live.
   Which goes to show: even if you use the word brogrammer you might
   still have good ideas.

** Meta Development

   Emagician sets up a few of its own functions for helpful debugging
   and development of itself.  Most of these are to be found in
   [[file:Emagician-Meta.org]], but a little bit of bootstrapping is nice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

	Since we now know where the emagician dir is, and it is okay, lets add that to the initial scratch message.

** Base initalization function set

   There are a number of baseline things we need to do, like custom loaders, macros for setting up hooks, etc. etc.

*** Starter Kit Load

   Originally from Eschulte.  This function takes a <foo>.org file,
   and load it.  It can also be given the argument of a sub tree, which 
   is defined as either a proper ord id, or a tag. 

   If the subtree is a tag, then all subtrees with that tag are collected and loaded.

  If the optional argument is the id of a subtree then only
  configuration from within that subtree will be loaded.  If it is
  not an id then it will be interpreted as a tag, and only subtrees
  marked with the given tag will be loaded.
  
  For example, to load all of lisp.org simply
  add (emagician-starter-kit-load \"lisp\") to your configuration.
  
  To load only the 'window-system' config from
  emagician-starter-kit-misc-recommended.org add

*** Load User/System Specific Files
***** System/User specific customizations
You can keep system- or user-specific customizations here in either
raw emacs-lisp files or as embedded elisp in org-mode files (as done
in this document).

You can keep elisp source in the =src= directory.  Packages loaded
from here will override those installed by ELPA.  This is useful if
you want to track the development versions of a project, or if a
project is not in elpa.

After we've loaded all the Starter Kit defaults, lets load the User's stuff.
