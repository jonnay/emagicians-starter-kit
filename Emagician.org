* Base initialization and Circle Casting

  Look, if you're here, either you're a mutant (horray!), or I have
  done something horribly wrong. (boo!).

  Frankly the defaults here should be good enough that no-one should
  need to change them.  And by good enough I mean, really basic things
  like bog-standard libraries required, package managers set up.
  Things like spaces, tabs, and all the important stuff are in their
  own file.

** Breakage happens, lets try and make it easier to deal with.
   Snarfed this idea from https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live.
   Which goes to show: even if you use the word brogrammer you might
   still have good ideas.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq initial-scratch-message
        (concat ";; -|-+-|- Invocation Failure.  Sorry." "\n"
                ";; You know what to do." "\n"
                ";; \n"
                ";; It's dangerous to go alone, here take this:" "\n"
                "(shell-command \"emacs --debug-init)"))
                
#+end_src  

** Meta Development

   Emagician sets up a few of its own functions for helpful debugging
   and development of itself.  Most of these are to be found in
   [[file:Emagician-Meta.org]], but a little bit of bootstrapping is nice.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun emagician-reload ()
  "Reload the init file"
  (interactive)
  (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "Emagician.org" emagician-dir)))
#+end_src

*** TODO custom agenda for Emagician

** Paths, Startup files, etc.

   Load paths, customizations, etc.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path emagician-dir)
(setq custom-file (concat emagician-dir "custom.el"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat emagician-dir "src"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (concat emagician-dir "dist"))
#+end_src

*** More breakage help
	Since we now know where the emagician dir is, and it is okay, lets add that to the initial scratch message.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq initial-scratch-message 
        (concat initial-scratch-message
                "\n"
                "(find-file-other-window emagician-dir)" "\n"
                "(find-file-other-window (concat emagician-dir \"*.org\") t)" "\n"))
#+end_src

** Ubiquitious Packages

   These need to be not-autoloaded, cause they are EVERYWHERE MAN.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'cl)
    (require 'saveplace)
    (require 'ffap)
    (require 'uniquify)
    (require 'ansi-color)
    (require 'recentf)
#+end_src

** ELPA 
   MELPA, ELPA and Marmalade!  Oh my!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq package-user-dir (concat emagician-dir "elpa"))
  
  (setq package-archives
        '(("gnu"         . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
          ("melpa"       . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")
          ("marmalade"   . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")))
  
  (package-initialize)
  
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))
#+end_src


   For sake of archival purposes, here are 2 other potential ELPA
   archives.

#+begin_example
            ("original"    . "http://tromey.com/elpa/")
            ("marmalade"   . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
#+end_example

*** TODO Loading stuff from ELPA automagickally
    http://kieranhealy.org/esk/starter-kit-elpa.html
** Themes
#+begin_src emacs_lisp
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (concat emagician-dir "themes"))
#+end_src 
** Base initalization function set

   There are a number of baseline things we need to do, like custom loaders, macros for setting up hooks, etc. etc.

*** Starter Kit Load

   Originally from Eschulte.  This function takes a <foo>.org file,
   and load it.  It can also be given the argument of a sub tree, which 
   is defined as either a proper ord id, or a tag. 

   If the subtree is a tag, then all subtrees with that tag are collected and loaded.



#+name: starter-kit-load
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defun emagician-starter-kit-load (file &optional header-or-tag)

    If the optional argument is the id of a subtree then only
    configuration from within that subtree will be loaded.  If it is
    not an id then it will be interpreted as a tag, and only subtrees
    marked with the given tag will be loaded.
    
    For example, to load all of lisp.org simply
    add (emagician-starter-kit-load \"lisp\") to your configuration.
    
    To load only the 'window-system' config from
    emagician-starter-kit-misc-recommended.org add
     (emagican-starter-kit-load \"misc-recommended\" \"window-system\")
    to your configuration."

*** Load User/System Specific Files
***** System/User specific customizations
You can keep system- or user-specific customizations here in either
raw emacs-lisp files or as embedded elisp in org-mode files (as done
in this document).

You can keep elisp source in the =src= directory.  Packages loaded
from here will override those installed by ELPA.  This is useful if
you want to track the development versions of a project, or if a
project is not in elpa.

After we've loaded all the Starter Kit defaults, lets load the User's stuff.

* Starter Kit Core

As with the other starter kit, there are some fundamentals that need
to be delt with. 

** Basic hook functions
   This macro will help build your turn-on-minor-mode functions that are so helpful, and automagickally add them to a major mode.  It won't try to re-define the turn-on mode if it is already defined.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defmacro emagician-minor-in-major-mode (major-mode minor-mode)
        (let ((turn-on-symbol (intern (concat "turn-on-" (symbol-name minor-mode)))))
          (list
           'progn 
           (when (not (fboundp turn-on-symbol))
             `(defun ,turn-on-symbol ()
                "Automagickally generated by emagicians starter kit."
                (,minor-mode +1)))
           `(add-hook ,major-mode ,minor-mode))))
    
    (ert-deftest emagician-test-minor-in-major-mode ()
      "emagician-minor-in-major macro test"
      (should (equal (macroexpand '(emagician-minor-in-major-mode elisp-mode paredit-mode))
                     '(progn (defun turn-on-paredit-mode "Automagickally generated by emagicians starter kit." (paredit-mode +1))
                             (add-hook elisp-mode paredit-mode)))))
    
#+end_src

*** Key Definition Hooks

   Bit of a crappy definition here, but it's something.  This can be probably better handled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defmacro emagician/define-mode-key (mode-name key command)
      (let ((define-key-fname (make-symbol (concat (symbol-name mode-name)
                                                   "-key-<"
                                                   (replace-regexp-in-string "\s"
                                                                             "_"
                                                                             (key-description key))

                                                   (symbol-name command)
                                                   "-hook"))))

           (add-hook (quote ,(make-symbol (concat (symbol-name mode-name) "-hook"))) 
                     (quote ,define-key-fname)))))

  )
#+end_src
**** TODO Figure out if this needs to be optimized
**** TODO make a new definition to build a custom command
** DONE Required Package handling

   Instead of having to front-load packages like paredit, slime, etc.   why can't they be auto-installed as needed?  That's what this does.

   This is so that required packages can be properly loaclized.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun emagician-expect-package (package)
    "If the named PACKAGE isn't currently installed, install it"
    (unless (package-installed-p package)
      (package-install package)))  
#+end_src

*** TODO make it check an internet connection before installing

* Development Core
  
  Ok, if you're an emagician, you're a developer of some kind or
  another.  You may "just" be working in eslip, or you might be a
  ployglot proficient in Low-level C, Scheme, Ruby and Rails, and
  Java. Either way, you're a dev.
** TODO Programming modes

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar programming-modes '()
