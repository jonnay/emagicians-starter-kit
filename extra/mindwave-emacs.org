mindwave-emacs is a chunk of elisp code that uses the
ThinkGearConnector program to pass off mindwave data directly to
emacs.  Bundled with it is a data logger, eeg power display and data logger.

Everything in this software is pulled from one giant org file.  The
documentation, source-code... everything.  This is all part of a
"proof of concept" of being able to write and release elisp all inside
of an orgmode file.

** Load the files

   This chunk of code is handy for loading the elisp files.  It is mostly for my own testing.  

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

  Mindwave emacs needs YOU!

  Here are a few things that need working on:

  - Better, reusable gnuplot graphs in data-gather-into-org
  - Better statistical analysis on the summary table in data-gather-into-org
  - Tweaks on data-gather-into-org to make it more user-friendly
  - Low level serial interface into mindwave, so that low-level EEG values can be recorded
  - better 'mark' interface for delineating incoming stimulus.  There might need to be 2 different interfaces, one for self experimenting mad scientists like myself, and one for actual scientists.
	
* Usage Examples and Applications

  If you want to start playing with mindwave emacs, you will want to have a look at the usage examples.  Each example is a fully functional piece of code that you can use for your neurological feedback needs.

  - gather-in-org :: Pulls eSense (attention/meditation) and eegPower (relative eeg bands) from the mindwave, and puts them into a formatted org table.
  - solarized-mind :: Displays attention level as the background of emacs.  Currently it assumes you are using the solarized-dark theme.  The more attentive you are, the lighter blue your background is.
  - mindwave-display :: throws up a buffer displaying the users current neurological state.  (eSense and eegPower)

** Basic testing code

	Here is some extremely early testing code that I was using to see
	if the mindwave code was working.  This is provided mostly for
	informational purposes.  For better example code, see the examples
	below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
(mindwave-get-buffer)
(mindwave-get-raw nil)
(mindwave-get-raw t)

(setq mindwave-hook nil)
(setq mindwave-raw-hook '())
(setq mindwave-blink-hook '())

(run-hook-with-args 'mindwave-blink-hook "foo")

(add-hook 'mindwave-hook 'mindwave-debug-standard)
(add-hook 'mindwave-raw-hook 'mindwave-debug-raw)
(add-hook 'mindwave-blink-hook 'mindwave-debug-blink)

(defun mindwave-debug-standard  (o) (message "Standard output: %S" o))
(defun mindwave-debug-raw (o) (message "Raw: %S" o))
(defun mindwave-debug-blink (o) (message "Blink: %S" o))

** Example one: gather data into an org buffer

	In this example, you can see how to use the base mindwave hooks to
	capture data into an org buffer.  This actually is far more then a
	simple example, and is really a full working suite of tools that
	you can use to examine your neurological state.

	However, I am not a neuroscientist, I am a computer programmer.
	If you happen to be a neuroscientist, psychologist or other
	scientist who can help out my process, I would LOVE to hear from
	you.

When you purchase a mindwave, it doesn't actually come with any
long-term data logging tools.  There is an open source tool to show
your brainwaves on a graph, but again it doesn't provide logging.

I wanted something simple that would provide that for me.

This chunk of code here illustrates how to use mindwave-emacs.  It
will collect the eSense, eegPower and signal level into a table, that
could theoretically be further processed into R, and then even plotted
with various programs.  I've provided some gnuplot code that will
graph things pretty nicely.

data-gather works in 2 different modes.  The first mode is continuous recording mode, and can be started wtih ~dg-mindwave/start-recording-session~.  This will start the recording, and won't stop it untill the command ~dg-mindwave/stop-recording-session~ is issued.

The second mode is a little different.  It is used for 45 second "calibration" sessions.  The theory is that you start the session, with 15 seconds of throw away data, and then the subject is to spend the next 15 seconds relaxing, and then the final 15 seconds doing a particular task.  This can be started with ~dg-mindwave/start-45-second-session~ and stops automatically after the 45 seconds. 

In both modes the concept of a "mark" applies.  This shows when a particular stimulus is encountered.  You can use ~dg-mindwave/generic-mark~ to insert a mark called "mark", or use ~dg-mindwave/mark~ to prompt for the name of the mark.  In their chase, once input, the mark will be inserted immediately.

*** Output Example 

	This is an example of the output of a 45 second recording session.  Notice the "relaxed" and "tester" marks.

*** Marks

   The basic concept of this data gathering scheme is the concept of
   'marks'.  During the examination of brainwaves, there may be
   external or internal stimulus that trigger a sensation which may
   (or may not) trigger a change in brainwave state.  that brainwave
   state should then be stored on the table for later analysis. 

   Right now a very simple interface is defined and provided.  One can
   either insert a generic "mark" into the table, and insert a
   prompted for mark.  A little later we will create a buffer that
   takes alpha characters as marks.

   - dg-mindwave/generic-mark :: Inserts a generic mark called "mark".
   - dg-mindwave/mark :: Prompt for a mark name, and mark it with
        that mark.  

   Note, that the act of prompting for a mark name already skews the
   results, right?

    (interactive "sMark: ")
    (setq dg-mindwave/mark mark))
#+end_src

**** TODO figure out a much better interface for marks

	 Right now the current mark implementation is clunky at best.  In
	 my ideal work I would like to have a way to receive these mark
	 inputs from the mindwave wearer in as unobtrusive a way as
	 possible.

*** Data collection

   This is where the magic happens.  A hook is set up to read the
   various values from the mindwave output, and then write them into
   an org-mode table.

***  Results Table 

	In my simple explorations, I found it handy to have a secondary
	table generated from the first that shows various simple
	statistical qualities.  

	Again, I am not a scientist, but I do find these result tables to
	be fairly informative.   If you have any ideas on how to make them
	better, let me know. 

	Note, that for now the code formatting, especially of the org-mode
	calc table is kinda yucky and could be better.

*** Window for mark input

	The mark window is a very simple mark interface.  It will allow
	you to use the lower case letters a through z to insert that
	letter as a mark, which can be used as a mnemonic for various

	Right now the buffer is just blank, but I will be working on
	improving it in the future.

*** Timed Recordings

Timed recordings are for micro-experimentation of your EEG.  The idea
is that you record EEG activity in 15 second chunks, which each chunk
being a different activity.

  1. a 'whatever chunk', and is basically 15 seconds of "whatever is
     going on right now". 
  2. a 15 second chunk of eyes closed and relaxing
  3. a 15 second chunk of experimentation or calibration, for instance:
	 - eyes closed and relaxing
	 - eyes opened and relaxing
	 - eyes closed and breathing deeply
	 - eyes open and doing complicated math problems.

This can be used for self experimentation.  At the 15 second mark,
Emacs will beep at you and tell you to close your eyes.  At the 30
second mark, it will beep at you and insert the name of the session as
a mark.  finally, it will beep at the 45 second mark and stop the
recording session.

#+end_src 

	Assuming you're using the solarized (dark) theme, lets say that you want the background color to change according to how attentive you are.
	
	- Attention :: Level of 'solarized purity of background color'.  The more attention, the more blue the solarized background.
	- Meditation :: Cursor blink rate, from 0.25 (less meditative) to 1 (more)

*** Set up Hooks

	There is a little bit of a tug of war going on.  Originally the
	"brain ring" lived in solarized mind, but I decided that it was
	too useful to leave stuck in there, and moved it into the main
	mindwave library.

	But, now I am under the impression that the brain-ring on the
	mindwave library is too much like solarzied mind.  So expect some
	push/pull between this library and the main, until it stabilizes.

	We set up a ring that is used to store both the attention and the
	meditation values.  Every second we store the data from the eSense
	and put it in the ring.  Once the ring is full, we "collapse" the
	ring, get the mean of those values, and stick them on the first
	element of the list.

	This provides a bit of continutity to the list.  It makes me
	wonder if there is a better way to handle it to provide more
	continuity overall, or even, if that is desirable?  Is it better
	to have small local updates as to ones relaxation and attention
	states, or is it better to have a global one?

**** Digressions

	 One option is to store say 5-10 elements of history as part of
	 the ring.  A ring inside of a ring if you will.  On the first
	 pass through the 30 elements, the average would be in position 1,
	 then the next round of averages in position 2, and so on, until
	 all 5 are filled up.

	 At this point, one of two strategies could be followed:
	 
	 1. The first element is over-written with the latest new values,
        and that continues on.  This would give an overall reading
        that progresses forward in time.
	 2. The mean of the first 5 elements is put into position 1, and
        then positions 2-5 are cleared, and the strategy continues.
        This has the benifit of always providing a baseline context.

***** TODO Set it up so that different strategies can be tried

*** User-interface

	Such as it is.  Right now there is only 2 commands:

	- solarized-mind/start :: Start solarized mind, set up the hook,
         and start mindwave.
	- solarized-mind/stop :: Remove the solarized mind hook.  Doesn't
         actually try and stop the mindwave connection however.

#+TBLFM: @3$2=@-2*@-1::@4$2=60*@-1::@5$2=@-1*60::@6$2=@-1/2^20

Of course, this is purely just for the data alone, not for any kind of other storage requirements.  Even with that in mind, I think we should be okay.

*** Setting everything up
** Example five: 23 million dollar man

   The Point of the 23 million dollar man (6 Million, adjusted for Eris and Inflation) is to gather enough mindwave data to start to reason about your brian during varios hours, days of the week, and perhaps even days of the month or days--or months--of the year.

   In order to do that, we will need data.  Lots of data.  But not too much data!

   So the point of the 23 million dollar man is to store some of that data.  Note that our grain size is rather large here (hour in a day).  It is only because of the eegPower bands that we can really do this.  

   As an example, it shows how to maintain a running average.

   Just as an aside, I am consdiering renaming this to 23-million-person, or even 23-million-erisian, because perhaps "23-million-man" is sexist.

	First, we will name a table and always write to that table.  Then when we're done writing, we'll make a new line, with the comment #mindwave-last-pos, and store our position in a variable.  This way we will be able to return to our pos, and verify that the position is right.

** Example five: magickal-commit.  Store total average brainwave state of a coding session in a magit commit.
   
   I am not sure how this is going to play out exactly yet, but this is something that needs to be done.

   During the editing of a file in a buffer, the attention/meditation level is stored on a per-buffer basis.  Before a magit commit, if the buffer/file is part of a repository, it should inject that files average into the commit.  Probably in a format like:
#+begin_src js :tangle no :export code
  // developer-state
  {
    "eeg" : {
        "eSense" : {
            "attention": 60,
            "meditation": 80
        }
    }  
  }
  // end-developer-state
#+end_src

   Node that we use json so that it is easily consumable by other
   tools.  Even though everyone knows that sexprs are way cooler.

*** Moving and Exponential Averages
	
	I'm going to start with the simplest case, which is to get a moving average of the last hour of brain activity.  It might also be interesting to play with Exponential Smoothing, but that comes later.

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing

	Note that the ring-full hook function will automagickally return an average of the last 30 values.

*** Connection
	There are 2 different ways to connect to the mind wave.  The first way is through the ThinkGear connector, and the second is via a raw serial connection.

	The ThinkGear connector is high level, slow, and easy to work with, providing JSON data.

	The raw serial method is low level, fast, and a little more difficult.

**** Connection variables - Think Gear Connector

According to the documentation of make-comint, if a running process is on the buffer, it is not restarted.  So isntead of trying to maintain state, lets just return the existing process that way.
 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun mindwave-get-buffer ()
    "Returns the buffer for the mindwave connection"
    (if (and mindwave-process (process-live-p mindwave-process))
        mindwave-process
        (progn
          (setq mindwave-buffer (make-comint "mindwave" (cons mindwave-host mindwave-port)))
          (setq mindwave-process (get-buffer-process mindwave-buffer))
          (save-excursion
            (set-buffer mindwave-buffer)
            (buffer-disable-undo mindwave-buffer)
            (sleep-for 1)
            (mindwave-authorize)
            (sleep-for 1)
            (mindwave-get-raw nil)
            (sleep-for 1)
            (add-hook 'comint-preoutput-filter-functions 'mindwave-comint-filter-function nil t))
          mindwave-buffer)))
  
#+end_src

***** Raw Serial

We'll be using the commands available here: [[info:elisp#Serial%20Ports]]

For now, we're going to assume that only a single serial port will be connected to a mindwave.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (defun mindwave-make-serial-process ()
    "Creates a serial process for mindwave, or returns the current one if it exists.
  Note that this function assumes that you'll only ever have one mindwave connected."
    (if (process-live-p mindwave-serial-process)
        mindwave-serial-process
      (setq mindwave-serial-process (make-serial-process :port mindwave-serial-port
                                                         :speed mindwave-serial-baud
                                                         :coding-system 'binary
                                                         :filter mindwave-serial-filter))))
#+end_src

Note that since we are in development mode right now, we are not going
to detach the buffer yet (but will soon). I think this can be done by
using ~:buffer nil~ in the make-serial-process args, but if not,
~(set-process-buffer mindwave-serial-process nil)~ should work.  Of
course, if we do that, we'll need to make sure the last form on that
function is ~mindwave-serial-process~ so it properly returns a process!

** Sending Data
#+name: get raw
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun mindwave-send-string (str)
  "Helper function to send STRING directly to the mindwave.
Please use `mindwave-authorize' or `mindwave-get-raw' for user-level configuration."
  (comint-send-string mindwave-process str))
#+end_src

** Recieving Data

   There are a few ways that you can receive data from mindwave emacs:
   
   - hook functions :: Whenever mindwave-emacs receives a particular piece of data, that hook is called with that data.  This (for instance) makes it easy to listen to only the attention/meditation levels from the mindwave.
   - current state :: You can also peek at the last-known values from the mindwave.
   - brain ring :: Finally, mindwave-emacs keeps track of the last 30 results, and stares them in a hook 

*** The hooks

   	These hook variables will be cross-connection type, and the arguments will be consistent across both.

   	The following hooks are defined:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defvar mindwave-hook '() "Hooks to run when mindwave gets standard input\nShould be a in a list that conforms to the json output.")
(defvar mindwave-blink-hook '() "Hooks to run when mindwave gets blink input")
(defvar mindwave-raw-eeg-hook '() "Hooks to run when mindwave gets raw eeg input.\n Note that you can get up to 512 of these events per second!")
(defvar mindwave-e-sense-hook '() "Hooks to run when mindwave gets an eSense(tm) reading")
(defvar mindwave-eeg-power-hook '() "Hooks to run when mindwave gets an eegPower reading")
#+end_src

**** ~mindwave-hook~ 

	Called on any input from the mindwave.  Note that there are no guarantees about what data will, or won't be available. The argument to the hook function is an alist generally in the format of:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  '((poorSignalLevel . 200)
    (eSense . ((attention . 0)
               (meditation . 0)))
    (eegPower . ((delta      . 0)
                 (theta      . 0)
                 (lowAlpha   . 0)
                 (highAlpha  . 0)
                 (lowBeta    . 0)
                 (highBeta   . 0)
                 (lowGamma   . 0)
                 (highGamma  . 0)))
    (blinkStrength . 0))
#+end_src

**** ~mindwave-blink-hook~ 
	 Called when a blink message is received. 

**** ~mindwave-raw-eeg-hook~ 
	 Called when raw EEG messages are received from the mindwave.  No timing guarantees are made.

**** ~mindwave-e-sense-hook~ 
	 Called when an eSense message is received (meditation/attention)

**** ~mindwave-eeg-power-hook~ 
	 Called when eegPower messages are received.

*** Brain Ring, a ring-storage of the last 30 vals

	The concept behind the brain ring is to keep a tally of the users neurological state.  The structure of the brain ring is similar to the standard mindwave structure.   That is to say, an alist of the following format:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  ((eSense   . ((meditation . 40)
                (attention  . 60)))
   (eegPower . ((delta      . 2)
                (theta      . 3)
                (lowAlpha   . 2)
                (highAlpha  . 3)
                (lowBeta    . 2)
                (highBeta   . 3)
                (lowGamma   . 2)
                (highGamma  . 3))))
#+end_src

This makes it possible to look at short term trends (and possibly
longer term) versus just the second-by-second eeg output.


Note, that the new ring stats out empty, but you can use the hook to
fill in new values if you want your average to retain some kind of
memory.  For an example of this, see the solarized-mind example.

***** Ring Update

	   This function is called on every eSense/eeg update.  When the
	   signal level is good, and the mindwave data contains both
	   eSense and eegPower items, it adds a new entry to the brain
	   ring.  When the brain ring is full it clears it out, and calls
	   the brain-ring-full-hook.

	   The size of the brain-ring is 30 items.

	   Note that in so doing, we don't actually have a ring per-sae.
	   We have a new data structure which is a running average of the last 30 

	   In the future, maybe it could ALSO be more hook-like.
