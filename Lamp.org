Mal-2 was once asked by one of his Disciples if he often prayed to
Eris. He replied with these words:

No, we Erisians seldom pray, it is much too dangerous. Charles Fort
has listed many factual incidences of ignorant people confronted with,
say, a drought, and then praying fervently -- and then getting the
entire village wiped out in a torrential flood.

       The Law of Fives

        the Law of Fives is one of the oldest Erisian Mysterees. It
was first revealed to Good Lord Omar and is one of the great
contributions to come from The Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus.
        POEE subscribes to the Law of Fives of Omar's sect. And POEE
also recognizes the holy 23 (2+3=5) that is incorporated by Episkopos
Dr. Mordecai Malignatus, KNS, into his Discordian sect, The Ancient
Illuminated Seers of Bavaria.
        The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN
FIVES, OR ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY APPROPRIATE TO 5.
        The Law of Fives is never wrong.  In the Erisian Archives is
        an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: "I find the
Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."

                          CONVENTIONAL CHAOS

GREYFACE

In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of
Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as
he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted
the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he
said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was
a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it.

It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that
particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the
disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway,
Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more
seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy
other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.

The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been
suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance
causes frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a
bad trip. Man has been on a bad trip for a long time now.

It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

sun and inner plants and I use it in arriving at many facts unknown to
science. For example, multiply nude earth's circumference 24,902.20656
by 61 and you get the distance of moon's orbit around the earth.  This
is slightly less than the actual distance because we have not yet
considered earth's atmosphere. So be it. Christopher Garth, Evanston

        One day Zarathud took his students to a pleasant pasture and
there he confronted The Sacred Chao while She was contentedly grazing.

commanding voice, "why don't you do something worthwhile. What is your
Purpose in Life, anyway?"

        Munching the tasty grass, The Sacred Chao replied "MU".*

        Upon hearing this, absolutely nobody was
enlightened. Primarily because nobody could understand Chinese.

 * "MU" is the Chinese ideogram for NO-THING

Grey Book Texts - I To say in day-to-day life that something is
"obvious" means, more often than not, that one concedes a note of
truth in exchange for a tolerance of the usual hypocrisy and
conditioning. You can, for example, make your opposite admit as being
obvious that there is no such thing as a theory that is absolutely
true; that will not stop them in any way from continuing to brandish
their "Truths" as before.  Hence, there is no higher aim than the
OBVIOUS. It is to approach the closest to a Truth which we know to be
inaccessible but whose gleam we can see.  The Obvious is a
protection. Not only does it make people run away, but it also
deceives by its rapid commonness, and by the fact that in Flat
people's minds, whatever is simple cannot be serious.
%%
Grey Book Texts - II An Individual has many personalities or
characters at the same time or alternately. (Recent cognitive brain
theory supports this.)  Most people little by little eliminate the
personalities considered to be dangerous by their peer group or
societal unit and finally keep only one: the social
personality... one-dimensional "FLAT" people. But other people, called
paradoxically "Individuals", are always trying to develop all their
personalities, even if there is an internal conflict between them. So
we can clearly see that the Individualist person logically must use
"WE" to name himself, whilst the person who belongs to the masses must
use the "I". The first is multi-dimensional, the second is
uni-dimensional.  One of the Temple functions is to encourage and
support the development of multi-dimensional Individuals. Hence our
use of "WE" in our texts.  Our enemies are Flat.
%%
Grey Book Texts - III Our stress on SELF discipline is important, it
links the internal methods of ritual to our approval and suggestion of
other forms of physical discipline to complement the mental/sexual
ones. Hence you will often find that Initiates of the Temple will be
engaged in such outside activities as Marksmanship, Martial Arts,
Swimming and so on as an extension of the theory of maintaining and
improving one's focus and abilities.  The point is not the skill in
itself, though we appreciate the practical nature, in a society such
as ours, of an Ability to defend oneself and be fit, but the
APPLICATION, the discipl1ne itself. So one may be poor in terms of
results, but excellent in terms of your genuine application to a skill
that requires thought, co-ordination and a degree of dedication. A
synthesis of physical action, thought, reflex and an analysis of both
yourself and a target (real or metaphysical).

I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little-death

will be nothing.  Only I will remain.

* Rid myself of Art Bollocks

  One of the problems I sort of have a lot of, is that I kind of use a lot of weasel words.  Perhaps I think I should leverage an Emacs plugin to change this.

  Like Really a lot.

* Random Kawaii
  I have a monster collection of photos that are so cute, or so awesome, they give me joy each time I see them.

  It would be cool to make mcli do something like that every once in awhile.  

  There is 2 things that'll have to happen:
  - Metadata for wallpaper
  - interface to m-cli:  ~m wallpaper path/to/wallpaper~

** TODO simple 'metadata'.  Just a list
** TODO Sort wallpapers
** TODO basic command to ~m wallpaper~

* Sierpinski
 ... is my jam! [fn:1]
