** It used to be that Once in blue moon, vi keys would happen  :history:
   That was before I really dug into Tramp mode.

   I would launch vim to edit a file on a remote server.  I know just
   enough vi to add characters and save and get out.  In fact, I would
   save with: ~<ESC>:w~ and then quit with ~<ESC>:q!~.  Not even
   ~<ESC>:wq!~

   This would hose my muscle memory though.  And sometimes I would try
   to do the same in emacs.

   By setting the var ~w~ to the string, when it is evaled with ESC-:
   the string is evaled instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq w! "uUuuuuuUUUuuuummmMMMmmmm.  This ain't vim.")
#+end_src

   Now that I can do most of everything I need through tramp, and the
   stuff I can't do I can from within a shell inside of emacs, this
   isn't needed anymore.

   I keep it around (but don't load it) because it's clevar and fun.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(defun sanityinc/kill-back-to-indentation ()
  "Kill from point back to the first non-whitespace character on the line."
  (interactive)

 #+end_src


* Automated things
** Midnight  :automation:
   It's very silent in the background, and just kind of does the right thing.  Clears out old buffers not in use.  I also use it as a next-day scheduler.
 
   I have seen some other Emagicians state that they didn't know why they had this package. See also [[*Diminish][Diminish]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(use-package midnight
  :init
  (setq clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names '("*httpd*"))
  :config
  (midnight-delay-set 'midnight-delay "4:30am"))
#+end_src

* Display   :display:

There is an argument that Emacs doesn't need to look pretty.  That all we're really doing is editing text, so why do anything to it beyond a basic theme to give you syntax highlighting.

I call bullshit.  All of us already live in a prison of existential crisis.  Why would we make our text editor any more of a prison?

I eat delicious food, not Soy-lent.

I drink excellent beer I find tasty, not Alberta Genuine Draft. 

ÆＳÞＥTＩC is important.

** Turn of scrollbars, toolbars, menu bars

All that said, there are some shit that is just ... not good.

Scrollbars, Toolbars and Menu Bars. Oh my.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(dolist (mode '(menu-bar-mode tool-bar-mode scroll-bar-mode))
    (when (fboundp mode) (funcall mode -1)))
#+end_src

** 🛎 Bell 🔔
   When emacs emits C-g (bell) to the user, it is to signal an error,
   warning or some other alert.

   When the user types C-g to emacs, it is to signal an error, or a
   need to quit.

   I rather enjoy that kind of poetry.

   I used to hate the visible bell when it flashed the whole screen,
   but it has sense gotten a lot better.  It flashes two bars at the
   top and bottom now rather than the whole screen, and is nice when
   you don't have the volume up.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(setq visible-bell t)
#+end_src

** Fonts

   Font choice is important aesthetically speaking. 

   Of the 4 fonts that came recommended to me, I went with Adobe Source Code Pro.  Here is my reasoning:

   - It looks great.
   - The o0 li1I handling is good.
   - The differences between ({[]}) are all super apparent.
   - It has a great set of weights.

*** Anonymous Pro
http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro

It's a wide font.  Very wide.  It comes highly regarded, but I am not
sure about its ÆＳÞＥTＩC yet. It is however easy to read. but it
does look a little awkward.  It's fundamental flaw is how the
parenthesis looks like a curly brace.

*** Unicode
#+begin_verse
Unicode
  |(⁀ₒ⁀)/    ,(   Get all teh characters! )
#+end_verse

The ~unicode-fonts~ package does a pretty good job of helping you get to a place where all characters can be displayed.  

You'll need a number of fonts to make this work, here is the bare minimum:
- Symbola :: http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/Symbola.zip
- Quivira :: http://www.quivira-font.com/files/Quivira.ttf
- Dejavu Sans :: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/files/dejavu/2.35/dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.35.tar.bz2
- Noto Sans :: https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/blob/master/hinted/NotoSans-Regular.ttc?raw=true
- Noto Sans Symbols :: https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts/blob/master/unhinted/NotoSansSymbols-Regular.ttf?raw=true

Really though, the key here is being able to get all the emoji.

The secret sauce to making sure to get all the emoji is ~(setq unicode-fonts-ignore-overrides t)~

#+begin_verse
  👯 ,( Get all teh Emoji! )
#+end_verse

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
(defun add-emoji-to-unicode-block (block-name)

** Maximize primary window

   This seems to be the best way to get emacs to be maximized on the primary display in a multi monitor setup on OS X.  I want emacs maximized on a single monitor, and not to create it's own OS X screen.

   You'd think that as an old Amiga head I'd enjoy the screen handling of OS X, but it just seems really clunky.  It doesn't have the same charm as the Other Raster Port.

** Soft Word Wrap / Visual Line Mode

   "Visual Line Mode" is probably the worst name ever.  

   I prefer movement and killing via logical lines, not visual lines. 

   Also, Indicators Plz!

   Thanks to Wasamasa[fn:3] for the funk of using ~(setcdr)~ on the map.  Brilliant.

   Shamelessly snarfed from bbatsov.

   Shows either the full file path or buffer name, and the name of the process when available.  

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

The modeline should show as much information as required, in as small a space as possible.  I am a too-much-info kinda guy.  It's a sickness.

*** Diminish

    I am not sure if it is Author: Will Mengarini, or Maintainer:
    Martin Yrjölä who came up with this, but it is the most poetic
    commentary in any lisp file I have seen so far:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
;; When we diminish a mode, we are saying we want it to continue doing its
;; work for us, but we no longer want to be reminded of it.  It becomes a
;; night worker, like a janitor; it becomes an invisible man; it remains a
;; component, perhaps an important one, sometimes an indispensable one, of
;; the mechanism that maintains the day-people's world, but its place in
;; their thoughts is diminished, usually to nothing.  As we grow old we
;; diminish more and more such thoughts, such people, usually to nothing.

;; "The wise man knows that to keep under is to endure."  The diminished
;; often come to value their invisibility.  We speak--speak--of "the strong
;; silent type", but only as a superficiality; a stereotype in a movie,
;; perhaps, but even if an acquaintance, necessarily, by hypothesis, a
;; distant one.  The strong silent type is actually a process.  It begins
;; with introspection, continues with judgment, and is shaped by the
;; discovery that these judgments are impractical to share; there is no
;; appetite for the wisdom of the self-critical among the creatures of
;; material appetite who dominate our world.  Their dominance's Darwinian
;; implications reinforce the self-doubt that is the germ of higher wisdom.
;; The thoughtful contemplate the evolutionary triumph of the predator.
;; Gnostics deny the cosmos could be so evil; this must all be a prank; the
;; thoughtful remain silent, invisible, self-diminished, and discover,
;; perhaps at first in surprise, the freedom they thus gain, and grow strong.

** Themes
*** Base theme: Moe, Moe, Kyun!
   This theme is my favorite so far.  It's got good color choices and it's nice and dark.

**** Set up different colors for different days

     The colors are:

     | Day       | apsect      | Color   | ☰  |
     |-----------+-------------+---------+---|
     | Sunday    | Benevolence | yellow  | 🌞 |
     | Monday    | Reverence   | blue    | 🌚 |
     | Tuesday   | Courage     | red     | ♂ |
     | Wednesday | Honesty     | cyan    | ☿ |
     | Thursday  | Rectitude   | green   | ♃ |
     | Friday    | Honour      | magenta | ♀ |
     | Saturday  | Loyalty     | b/w     | ♄ |

     Note that at this point the 7 day cycle of days beats against the 8 day cycle of good modelines, see [[*The Separator][The Separator]] of the modeline.

** The Mark
*** Transient mark mode

  For now Transient Mark mode is just turned off.  I don't like
  transients.

  Seriously though, the reason why I like not having transient mark
  mode is that I have gotten into the habit of dropping marks and
  using the mark ring.  I also use the mark for nagivation, and having
  transient mark mode on messes with my workflow.

  If you are opposite, then let me know (file a bug report:
  https://github.com/jonnay/emagicians-starter-kit/issues/new) and
  I'll fix the emagicians kit so that transient mark mode can be
  easily activated.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

** TODO Try out IVY instead of helm
** Helm
   I have a complicated relationship with helm.  

   - ⛥ :: On the one hand its completion mechanism just does what I expect.  Little to no fuss nor muss.
   - ⛥ :: On the other hand it's a bitch to extend and seems to have gotten very far from it's easy-to-extend Anything roots.  Case-in-point: ~M-x~ used to not only show commands, but give you actions to provide documentation for them, their source location, as well as a whole host of other things.  I miss that.

   It's still a demand package though.

**** Key binding muscle memory
     The Fix-Muscle Memory keybinding setting re-enables the "You can run the command ~foo~ with ~bar~". This is one of the annoyances with ~Helm-M-x~ for me.
