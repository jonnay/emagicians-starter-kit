* Files
** Loading and saving
*** Tramp Setup
**** TODO magic here to do The Right Thing (tm) for tramp, regardless of what OS is being used to execute it. 
**** TODO the best mode (scp? ssh? something else?) should be set as the default.
**** Set tramp up to play nicely with NixOS

(require 'tramp) 
(add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/var/run/current-system/sw/bin")

** Backups
*** Disabling this was such a monumentally stupidly bad idea. 
	My excuse is that it was a self-inflicted curse for not understanding what I was snarfing and barfing.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

*** Backup files are annoying, until they save your skin 
This was snarfed from Magnars [fn:1]

* Transient mark mode

  For now Transient Mark mode is just turned off.  I don't like
  transients.

  Seriously though, the reason why I like not having transient mark
  mode is that I have gotten into the habit of dropping marks and
  using the mark ring.  I also use the mark for nagivation, and having
  transient mark mode on messes with my workflow.

  If you are opposite, then let me know (file a bug report:
  https://github.com/jonnay/emagicians-starter-kit/issues/new) and
  I'll fix the emagicians kit so that transient mark mode can be
  easily activated.

* Working with Text
** Filling
*** Unfill [fn:2]
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun unfill-paragraph ()
  "Unfill a paragraph at or after point."
  (interactive)
  (let ((fill-column (point-max)))
    (fill-paragraph nil)))

(global-set-key (kbd "M-Q") 'unfill-paragraph)
#+end_src
** Killing and yanking
*** TODO Swap region with kill ring
*** TODO Insert-yank-as-rectangle
*** when yanking, indent according to the mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defadvice yank (after indent-region activate)
    "indent the region after a yank if we're in a programming mode."
    (if (derived-mode-p 'prog-mode)
        (indent-region (region-beginning) (region-end) nil)))
#+end_src
**** TODO make sure there is a way to not indent accoring to the mode
***** NEXT write the advice to be around, so it can skip on a prefix arg of 0.
*** kill-buffer-file-name

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun kill-buffer-file-name () 
    "Show current buffer's filename in the echo area and add it to the kill ring."

        (message "%s" (kill-new buffer-file-name)))))
#+end_src
** Indenting and tabbing 
  I am not going to solve this for everyone and try to be all things for all peope.  In fact I will bet money that my style of indentation kinda sucks, and look to the emacs community to help me to stop sucking.

*** Change Behavior of the home key

* Delimiters
** Rainbow Delimiters 
   Not really sure if this should be interface, or more in the movement and editing section.

   It's nice to have a good string for testing:
   (((((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))))))

   I am not 100% sure I like this colorscheme.  The Angry red unmatched delimiter is nice.
