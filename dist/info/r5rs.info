Summary
*******

The report gives a defining description of the programming language
Scheme.  Scheme is a statically scoped and properly tail-recursive
dialect of the Lisp programming language invented by Guy Lewis Steele
Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was designed to have an exceptionally
clear and simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.
A wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative,
functional, and message passing styles, find convenient expression in
Scheme.

The introduction offers a brief history of the language and of the
report.

The first three chapters present the fundamental ideas of the language
and describe the notational conventions used for describing the
language and for writing programs in the language.

Chapters *Note Expressions:: and *Note Program structure:: describe the
syntax and semantics of expressions, programs, and definitions.

Chapter *Note Standard procedures:: describes Scheme's built-in
procedures, which include all of the language's data manipulation and
input/output primitives.

Chapter *Note Formal syntax and semantics:: provides a formal syntax
for Scheme written in extended BNF, along with a formal denotational
semantics.  An example of the use of the language follows the formal
syntax and semantics.

The report concludes with a list of references and an alphabetic index.       |

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
additional features appear necessary.  Scheme demonstrates that a very
small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on
how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient
programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the
major programming paradigms in use today.

Scheme was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first
class procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the
usefulness of static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically
typed language.  Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to
distinguish procedures from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a
single lexical environment for all variables, and to evaluate the
operator position of a procedure call in the same way as an operand
position.  By relying entirely on procedure calls to express iteration,
Scheme emphasized the fact that tail-recursive procedure calls are
essentially goto's that pass arguments.  Scheme was the first widely
used programming language to embrace first class escape procedures,
from which all previously known sequential control structures can be
synthesized.  A subsequent version of Scheme introduced the concept of        |
exact and inexact numbers, an extension of Common Lisp's generic              |
arithmetic.  More recently, Scheme became the first programming               |
language to support hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a             |
block-structured language to be extended in a consistent and reliable         |
manner.                                                                       |

Background
==========

The first description of Scheme was written in 1975 [Scheme75].  A
revised report [Scheme78]  appeared in 1978, which described the
evolution of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to
support an innovative compiler [Rabbit].  Three distinct projects began
in 1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
Indiana University [Rees82], [MITScheme], [Scheme311].  An introductory
computer science textbook using Scheme was published in 1984 [SICP].

As Scheme became more widespread, local dialects began to diverge until
students and researchers occasionally found it difficult to understand
code written at other sites.  Fifteen representatives of the major
implementations of Scheme therefore met in October 1984 to work toward
a better and more widely accepted standard for Scheme.

Their report [RRRS] was published at MIT and Indiana University in the
summer of 1985.  Further revision took place in the spring of 1986            |
[R3RS], and in the spring of 1988 [R4RS].  The present report reflects        |
further revisions agreed upon in a meeting at Xerox PARC in June 1992.        |




We intend this report to belong to the entire Scheme community, and so
we grant permission to copy it in whole or in part without fee.  In
particular, we encourage implementors of Scheme to use this report as a
starting point for manuals and other documentation, modifying it as
necessary.

Semantics
=========

This section gives an overview of Scheme's semantics.  A detailed
informal semantics is the subject of chapters *Note Basic concepts::
through *Note Standard procedures::.  For reference purposes, section
*Note Formal semantics:: provides a formal semantics of Scheme.

Following Algol, Scheme is a statically scoped programming language.
Each use of a variable is associated with a lexically apparent binding
of that variable.

Scheme has latent as opposed to manifest types.  Types are associated
with values (also called objects) rather than with variables.  (Some
authors refer to languages with latent types as weakly typed or
dynamically typed languages.)  Other languages with latent types are
APL, Snobol, and other dialects of Lisp.  Languages with manifest types
(sometimes referred to as strongly typed or statically typed languages)
include Algol 60, Pascal, and C.

All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation, including
procedures and continuations, have unlimited extent.  No Scheme object
is ever destroyed.  The reason that implementations of Scheme do not
(usually!) run out of storage is that they are permitted to reclaim the
storage occupied by an object if they can prove that the object cannot
possibly matter to any future computation.  Other languages in which
most objects have unlimited extent include APL and other Lisp dialects.

Implementations of Scheme are required to be properly tail-recursive.
This allows the execution of an iterative computation in constant space,
even if the iterative computation is described by a syntactically
recursive procedure.  Thus with a properly tail-recursive                     |
implementation, iteration can be expressed using the ordinary                 |
procedure-call mechanics, so that special iteration constructs are            |
useful only as syntactic sugar.  See section *Note Proper tail
recursion::.                                                                  |

Scheme procedures are objects in their own right.  Procedures can be
created dynamically, stored in data structures, returned as results of
procedures, and so on.  Other languages with these properties include
Common Lisp and ML.

One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations, which in
most other languages only operate behind the scenes, also have
"first-class" status.  Continuations are useful for implementing a wide
variety of advanced control constructs, including non-local exits,
backtracking, and coroutines.  See section *Note Control features::.

Arguments to Scheme procedures are always passed by value, which means
that the actual argument expressions are evaluated before the procedure
gains control, whether the procedure needs the result of the evaluation
or not.  ML, C, and APL are three other languages that always pass
arguments by value.  This is distinct from the lazy-evaluation
semantics of Haskell, or the call-by-name semantics of Algol 60, where
an argument expression is not evaluated unless its value is needed by
the procedure.

Scheme's model of arithmetic is designed to remain as independent as
possible of the particular ways in which numbers are represented within
a computer. In Scheme, every integer is a rational number, every
rational is a real, and every real is a complex number.  Thus the
distinction between integer and real arithmetic, so important to many
programming languages, does not appear in Scheme.  In its place is a
distinction between exact arithmetic, which corresponds to the
mathematical ideal, and inexact arithmetic on approximations.  As in
Common Lisp, exact arithmetic is not limited to integers.

Syntax
======

Scheme, like most dialects of Lisp, employs a fully parenthesized prefix
notation for programs and (other) data; the grammar of Scheme generates
a sublanguage of the language used for data.  An important consequence
of this simple, uniform representation is the susceptibility of Scheme
programs and data to uniform treatment by other Scheme programs.  For         |
example, the `eval' procedure evaluates a Scheme program expressed as         |
data.                                                                         |

The `read' procedure performs syntactic as well as lexical
decomposition of the data it reads.  The `read' procedure parses its
input as data (section *note External representation::), not as program.

The formal syntax of Scheme is described in section *Note Formal
syntax::.

Primitive; library; and optional features                                     |
-----------------------------------------                                     |

It is required that every implementation of Scheme support all features       |
that are not marked as being "optional".  Implementations are free to         |
omit optional features of Scheme or to add extensions, provided the           |
extensions are not in conflict with the language reported here.  In
particular, implementations must support portable code by providing a
syntactic mode that preempts no lexical conventions of this report.           |
                                                                              |
To aid in understanding and implementing Scheme, some features are            |
marked as "library". These can be easily implemented in terms of the          |
other, primitive, features.  They are redundant in the strict sense of        |
the word, but they capture common patterns of usage, and are therefore        |
provided as convenient abbreviations.                                         |

Error situations and unspecified behavior
-----------------------------------------

When speaking of an error situation, this report uses the phrase "an
error is signalled" to indicate that implementations must detect and
report the error.  If such wording does not appear in the discussion of
an error, then implementations are not required to detect or report the
error, though they are encouraged to do so.  An error situation that
implementations are not required to detect is usually referred to simply
as "an error."

For example, it is an error for a procedure to be passed an argument
that the procedure is not explicitly specified to handle, even though
such domain errors are seldom mentioned in this report.
Implementations may extend a procedure's domain of definition to
include such arguments.

This report uses the phrase "may report a violation of an
implementation restriction" to indicate circumstances under which an
implementation is permitted to report that it is unable to continue
execution of a correct program because of some restriction imposed by
the implementation.  Implementation restrictions are of course
discouraged, but implementations are encouraged to report violations of
implementation restrictions.

For example, an implementation may report a violation of an
implementation restriction if it does not have enough storage to run a
program.

If the value of an expression is said to be "unspecified," then the
expression must evaluate to some object without signalling an error,
but the value depends on the implementation; this report explicitly does
not say what value should be returned.

Entry format
------------

Chapters *Note Expressions:: and *Note Standard procedures:: are
organized into entries.  Each entry describes one language feature or a
group of related features, where a feature is either a syntactic
construct or a built-in procedure.  An entry begins with one or more
header lines of the form

 - CATEGORY: TEMPLATE                                                         |

for required, primitive features, or                                          |

 - QUALIFIER CATEGORY: TEMPLATE                                               |

where QUALIFIER is either "library" or "optional" as defined  in              |
section *Note Primitive; library; and optional features::.                    |

If CATEGORY is "syntax", the entry describes an expression type, and
the template gives the syntax of the expression type.  Components of          |
expressions are designated by syntactic variables, which are written
using angle brackets, for example, <expression>, <variable>.  Syntactic
variables should be understood to denote segments of program text; for
example, <expression> stands for any string of characters which is a
syntactically valid expression.  The notation

 <thing1> ...

indicates zero or more occurrences of a <thing>, and

 <thing1> <thing2> ...

indicates one or more occurrences of a <thing>.

If CATEGORY is "procedure", then the entry describes a procedure, and
the header line gives a template for a call to the procedure.  Argument
names in the template are ITALICIZED.  Thus the header line

 - procedure: (vector-ref VECTOR K)                                           |

indicates that the built-in procedure vector-ref takes two arguments, a       |
vector VECTOR and an exact non-negative integer K (see below).  The           |
header lines                                                                  |

 - procedure: (make-vector K)                                                 |
 - procedure: (make-vector K FILL)

indicate that the make-vector procedure must be defined to take either        |
one or two arguments.                                                         |

It is an error for an operation to be presented with an argument that it
is not specified to handle.  For succinctness, we follow the convention
that if an argument name is also the name of a type listed in section
*Note Disjointness of types::, then that argument must be of the named
type.  For example, the header line for vector-ref given above dictates
that the first argument to vector-ref must be a vector.  The following
naming conventions also imply type restrictions:

                                   
    OBJ
          any object

    LIST, LIST1, ... LISTJ, ...
          list (see section *note Pairs and lists::)

    Z, Z1, ... ZJ, ...
          complex number

    X, X1, ... XJ, ...
          real number

    Y, Y1, ... YJ, ...
          real number

    Q, Q1, ... QJ, ...
          rational number

    N, N1, ... NJ, ...
          integer

    K, K1, ... KJ, ...
          exact non-negative integer

Evaluation examples
-------------------

The symbol "=>" used in program examples should be read "evaluates to."
For example,


     (* 5 8)                                ==>  40

means that the expression (* 5 8) evaluates to the object 40.  Or, more
precisely:  the expression given by the sequence of characters "(* 5
8)" evaluates, in the initial environment, to an object that may be
represented externally by the sequence of characters "40".  See section
*Note External representations:: for a discussion of external
representations of objects.

Naming conventions
------------------

By convention, the names of procedures that always return a boolean
value usually end in "`?'".  Such procedures are called predicates.

By convention, the names of procedures that store values into previously
allocated locations (see section *note Storage model::) usually end in
"`!'".  Such procedures are called mutation procedures.  By convention,
the value returned by a mutation procedure is unspecified.

By convention, "`->'" appears within the names of procedures that take
an object of one type and return an analogous object of another type.
For example, `list->vector' takes a list and returns a vector whose
elements are the same as those of the list.

This section gives an informal account of some of the lexical
conventions used in writing Scheme programs.  For a formal syntax of
Scheme, see section *Note Formal syntax::.

Upper and lower case forms of a letter are never distinguished except
within character and string constants.  For example, `Foo' is the same
identifier as `FOO', and #x1AB is the same number as #X1ab.

Identifiers
===========

Most identifiers allowed by other programming languages are also
acceptable to Scheme.  The precise rules for forming identifiers vary
among implementations of Scheme, but in all implementations a sequence
of letters, digits, and "extended alphabetic characters" that begins
with a character that cannot begin a number is an identifier.  In
addition, `+', `-', and `...' are identifiers.  Here are some examples
of identifiers:


     lambda                   q
     list->vector             soup
     +                        V17a
     <=?                      a34kTMNs
     the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings

Extended alphabetic characters may be used within identifiers as if
they were letters.  The following are extended alphabetic characters:


     ! $ % & * + - . / : < = > ? @ ^ _ ~                                      |

See section *Note Lexical structure:: for a formal syntax of
identifiers.

Identifiers have two uses within Scheme programs:                             |

   * Any identifier may be used as a variable or as a syntactic keyword       |
     (see sections *note Variables; syntactic keywords; and regions::         |
     and *note Macros::).                                                     |

   * When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal (see
     section *note Literal expressions::), it is being used to denote a
     _symbol_ (see section *note Symbols::).

                                                                              |

Whitespace and comments
=======================

"Whitespace" characters are spaces and newlines.  (Implementations
typically provide additional whitespace characters such as tab or page
break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and as necessary
to separate tokens from each other, a token being an indivisible
lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is otherwise
insignificant.  Whitespace may occur between any two tokens, but not
within a token.  Whitespace may also occur inside a string, where it is
significant.

A semicolon (;) indicates the start of a comment.  The comment
continues to the end of the line on which the semicolon appears.
Comments are invisible to Scheme, but the end of the line is visible as
whitespace.  This prevents a comment from appearing in the middle of an
identifier or number.

     ;;; of a non-negative integer.

Other notations
===============

For a description of the notations used for numbers, see section *Note
Numbers::.

. + -
     These are used in numbers, and may also occur anywhere in an
     identifier except as the first character.  A delimited plus or
     minus sign by itself is also an identifier.  A delimited period
     (not occurring within a number or identifier) is used in the
     notation for pairs (section *note Pairs and lists::), and to
     indicate a rest-parameter in a  formal parameter list (section
     *note Procedures::).  A delimited sequence of three successive           |
     periods is also an identifier.                                           |

( )
     Parentheses are used for grouping and to notate lists (section
     *note Pairs and lists::).

'
     The single quote character is used to indicate literal data
     (section *note Literal expressions::).

`
     The backquote character is used to indicate almost-constant data
     (section *note Quasiquotation::).

, ,@
     The character comma and the sequence comma at-sign are used in
     conjunction with backquote (section *note Quasiquotation::).

"
     The double quote character is used to delimit strings (section
     *note Strings::).

\
     Backslash is used in the syntax for character constants (section
     *note Characters::) and as an escape character within string
     constants (section *note Strings::).

[ ] { } |                                                                     |
     Left and right square brackets and curly braces and vertical bar         |
     are reserved for possible future extensions to the language.             |

#
     Sharp sign is used for a variety of purposes depending on the
     character that immediately follows it:

#t #f
     These are the boolean constants (section *note Booleans::).

#\
     This introduces a character constant (section *note Characters::).

#(
     This introduces a vector constant (section *note Vectors::).
     Vector constants are terminated by ) .

#e #i #b #o #d #x
     These are used in the notation for numbers (section *note Syntax
     of numerical constants::).

==========================================                                    |

An identifier may name a type of syntax, or it may name a location            |
where a value can be stored.  An identifier that names a type of syntax       |
is called a _syntactic keyword_ and is said to be _bound_ to that             |
syntax.  An identifier that names a location is called a _variable_ and       |
is said to be _bound_ to that location.  The set of all visible               |
bindings in effect at some point in a program is known as the                 |
_environment_ in effect at that point.  The value stored in the               |
location to which a variable is bound is called the variable's value.         |
By abuse of terminology, the variable is sometimes said to name the           |
value or to be bound to the value.  This is not quite accurate, but           |
confusion rarely results from this practice.                                  |
                                                                              |
Certain expression types are used to create new kinds of syntax and           |
bind syntactic keywords to those new syntaxes, while other expression         |
types create new locations and bind variables to those locations.             |
These expression types are called _binding constructs_.                       |
                                                                              |
Those that bind syntactic keywords are listed in section *Note Macros::.      |
The most fundamental of the variable binding constructs is the `lambda'       |
expression, because all other variable binding constructs can be              |
explained in terms of `lambda' expressions.  The other variable binding       |
constructs are `let', `let*', `letrec', and `do' expressions (see             |
sections *note Procedures::, *note Binding constructs::, and *note            |
Iteration::).                                                                 |

Like Algol and Pascal, and unlike most other dialects of Lisp except
for Common Lisp, Scheme is a statically scoped language with block
structure.  To each place where an identifier is bound in a program           |
there corresponds a "region" of the program text within which the             |
binding is visible.  The region is determined by the particular binding       |
construct that establishes the binding; if the binding is established
by a `lambda' expression, for example, then its region is the entire          |
`lambda' expression.  Every mention of an identifier refers to the            |
binding of the identifier that established the innermost of the regions       |
containing the use.  If there is no binding of the identifier whose           |
region contains the use, then the use refers to the binding for the           |
variable in the top level environment, if any (chapters *note                 |
Expressions:: and *note Standard procedures::); if there is no binding        |
for the identifier, it is said to be "unbound".                               |

No object satisfies more than one of the following predicates:                |
                                                                              |

     boolean?          pair?                                                  |
     symbol?           number?                                                |
     char?             string?                                                |
     vector?           port?                                                  |
     procedure?                                                               |

These predicates define the types _boolean_, _pair_, _symbol_,                |
_number_, _char_ (or _character_), _string_, _vector_, _port_, and            |
_procedure_.  The empty list is a special object of its own type; it          |
satisfies none of the above predicates.                                       |
                                                                              |
Although there is a separate boolean type, any Scheme value can be used       |
as a boolean value for the purpose of a conditional test.  As explained       |
in section *Note Booleans::, all values count as true in such a test          |
except for #f.  This report uses the word "true" to refer to any Scheme       |
value except #f, and the word "false" to refer to #f.                         |

External representations
========================

An important concept in Scheme (and Lisp) is that of the _external
representation_ of an object as a sequence of characters.  For example,
an external representation of the integer 28 is the sequence of
characters "28", and an external representation of a list consisting of
the integers 8 and 13 is the sequence of characters "(8 13)".

The external representation of an object is not necessarily unique.  The
integer 28 also has representations "#e28.000" and "#x1c", and the list
in the previous paragraph also has the representations "( 08 13 )" and
"(8 . (13 . ()))" (see section *note Pairs and lists::).

Many objects have standard external representations, but some, such as
procedures, do not have standard representations (although particular
implementations may define representations for them).

An external representation may be written in a program to obtain the
corresponding object (see `quote', section *note Literal expressions::).

External representations can also be used for input and output.  The
procedure `read' (section *note Input::) parses external
representations, and the procedure `write' (section *note Output::)
generates them.  Together, they provide an elegant and powerful
input/output facility.

Note that the sequence of characters "(+ 2 6)" is _not_ an external
representation of the integer 8, even though it _is_ an expression
evaluating to the integer 8; rather, it is an external representation
of a three-element list, the elements of which are the symbol + and the
integers 2 and 6.  Scheme's syntax has the property that any sequence
of characters that is an expression is also the external representation
of some object.  This can lead to confusion, since it may not be
obvious out of context whether a given sequence of characters is
intended to denote data or program, but it is also a source of power,
since it facilitates writing programs such as interpreters and
compilers that treat programs as data (or vice versa).

The syntax of external representations of various kinds of objects
accompanies the description of the primitives for manipulating the
objects in the appropriate sections of chapter *Note Standard
procedures::.

Storage model
=============

Variables and objects such as pairs, vectors, and strings implicitly
denote locations or sequences of locations.  A string, for example,
denotes as many locations as there are characters in the string.
(These locations need not correspond to a full machine word.) A new
value may be stored into one of these locations using the string-set!
procedure, but the string continues to denote the same locations as
before.

An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by a
procedure such as `car', `vector-ref', or `string-ref', is equivalent
in the sense of `eqv?' (section *note Equivalence predicates::) to the
object last stored in the location before the fetch.

Every location is marked to show whether it is in use.  No variable or
object ever refers to a location that is not in use.  Whenever this
report speaks of storage being allocated for a variable or object, what
is meant is that an appropriate number of locations are chosen from the
set of locations that are not in use, and the chosen locations are
marked to indicate that they are now in use before the variable or
object is made to denote them.

In many systems it is desirable for constants (i.e. the values of
literal expressions) to reside in read-only-memory.  To express this,
it is convenient to imagine that every object that denotes locations is
associated with a flag telling whether that object is mutable or
immutable.  In such systems literal constants and the strings returned        |
by `symbol->string' are immutable objects, while all objects created by       |
the other procedures listed in this report are mutable.  It is an error       |
to attempt to store a new value into a location that is denoted by an         |
immutable object.

Proper tail recursion                                                         |
=====================                                                         |
                                                                              |
Implementations of Scheme are required to be _properly tail-recursive_.       |
Procedure calls that occur in certain syntactic contexts defined below        |
are `tail calls'.  A Scheme implementation is properly tail-recursive         |
if it supports an unbounded number of active tail calls.  A call is           |
_active_ if the called procedure may still return.  Note that this            |
includes calls that may be returned from either by the current                |
continuation or by continuations captured earlier by                          |
`call-with-current-continuation' that are later invoked.  In the              |
absence of captured continuations, calls could return at most once and        |
the active calls would be those that had not yet returned.  A formal          |
definition of proper tail recursion can be found in                           |
[propertailrecursion].                                                        |
                                                                              |
     _Rationale:_                                                             |
                                                                              |
     Intuitively, no space is needed for an active tail call because the      |
     continuation that is used in the tail call has the same semantics        |
     as the continuation passed to the procedure containing the call.         |
     Although an improper implementation might use a new continuation         |
     in the call, a return to this new continuation would be followed         |
     immediately by a return to the continuation passed to the                |
     procedure.  A properly tail-recursive implementation returns to          |
     that continuation directly.                                              |
                                                                              |
     Proper tail recursion was one of the central ideas in Steele and         |
     Sussman's original version of Scheme.  Their first Scheme                |
     interpreter implemented both functions and actors.  Control flow         |
     was expressed using actors, which differed from functions in that        |
     they passed their results on to another actor instead of returning       |
     to a caller.  In the terminology of this section, each actor             |
     finished with a tail call to another actor.                              |
                                                                              |
     Steele and Sussman later observed that in their interpreter the          |
     code for dealing with actors was identical to that for functions         |
     and thus there was no need to include both in the language.              |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
A _tail call_ is a procedure call that occurs in a _tail context_.            |
Tail contexts are defined inductively.  Note that a tail context is           |
always determined with respect to a particular lambda expression.             |
                                                                              |

   * If a `cond' expression is in a tail context, and has a clause of         |
     the form `(<expression1> => <expression2>)' then the (implied)           |
     call to the procedure that results from the evaluation of                |
     <expression2> is in a tail context.  <expression2> itself is not         |
     in a tail context.                                                       |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
Certain built-in procedures are also required to perform tail calls.          |
The first argument passed to `apply' and to                                   |
`call-with-current-continuation', and the second argument passed to           |
`call-with-values', must be called via a tail call.  Similarly, `eval'        |
must evaluate its argument as if it were in tail position within the          |
`eval' procedure.                                                             |
                                                                              |
In the following example the only tail call is the call to `f'.  None         |
of the calls to `g' or `h' are tail calls.  The reference to `x' is in        |
a tail context, but it is not a call and thus is not a tail call.             |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
     (lambda ()                                                               |
       (if (g)                                                                |
           (let ((x (h)))                                                     |
             x)                                                               |
           (and (g) (f))))                                                    |
                                                                              |
     _Note:_ Implementations are allowed, but not required, to                |
     recognize that some non-tail calls, such as the call to `h' above,       |
     can be evaluated as though they were tail calls.  In the example         |
     above, the `let' expression could be compiled as a tail call to          |
     `h'. (The possibility of `h' returning an unexpected number of           |
     values can be ignored, because in that case the effect of the            |
     `let' is explicitly unspecified and implementation-dependent.)           |
                                                                              |

Expression types are categorized as _primitive_ or _derived_.
Primitive expression types include variables and procedure calls.
Derived expression types are not semantically primitive, but can instead
be defined as macros.  With the exception of `quasiquote', whose macro        |
definition is complex, the derived expressions are classified as              |
library features.  Suitable definitions are given in section *Note            |

Variable references
-------------------

 - syntax: <variable>                                                         |
     An expression consisting of a variable (section *note Variables;         |
     syntactic keywords; and regions::) is a variable reference.  The         |
     value of the variable reference is the value stored in the               |
     location to which the variable is bound.  It is an error to              |
     reference an unbound variable.                                           |

     (define x 28)
     x                                      ==>  28

Literal expressions
-------------------

 - syntax: quote <datum>                                                      |
 - syntax: '<datum>                                                           |
 - syntax: <constant>                                                         |
     `(quote <datum>)' evaluates to <datum>.  <Datum> may be any
     external representation of a Scheme object (see section *note
     External representations::).  This notation is used to include
     literal constants in Scheme code.


     (quote a)                              ==>  a
     (quote #(a b c))                       ==>  #(a b c)
     (quote (+ 1 2))                        ==>  (+ 1 2)

     `(quote <datum>)' may be abbreviated as '<datum>.  The two
     notations are equivalent in all respects.

     'a                                     ==>  a
     '#(a b c)                              ==>  #(a b c)
     '()                                    ==>  ()
     '(+ 1 2)                               ==>  (+ 1 2)
     '(quote a)                             ==>  (quote a)
     ''a                                    ==>  (quote a)

     Numerical constants, string constants, character constants, and
     boolean constants evaluate "to themselves"; they need not be
     quoted.

     '"abc"                                 ==>  "abc"
     "abc"                                  ==>  "abc"
     '145932                                ==>  145932
     145932                                 ==>  145932
     '#t                                    ==>  #t
     #t                                     ==>  #t

     As noted in section *Note Storage model::, it is an error to alter
     a constant (i.e. the value of a literal expression) using a
     mutation procedure like `set-car!' or `string-set!'.



File: r5rs.info,  Node: Procedure calls,  Next: Procedures,  Prev: Literal expressions,  Up: Primitive expression types
                                                                              |
Procedure calls
---------------

 - syntax: (<operator> <operand1> ...)                                        |
     A procedure call is written by simply enclosing in parentheses
     expressions for the procedure to be called and the arguments to be
     passed to it.  The operator and operand expressions are evaluated
     (in an unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is passed
     the resulting arguments.


     (+ 3 4)                                ==>  7
     ((if #f + *) 3 4)                      ==>  12

     A number of procedures are available as the values of variables in
     the initial environment; for example, the addition and
     multiplication procedures in the above examples are the values of
     the variables `+' and `*'.  New procedures are created by
     evaluating lambda expressions (see section *note Procedures::).          |
                                                                              |
     Procedure calls may return any number of values (see `values' in         |
     section *note Control features::).  With the exception of `values'       |
     the procedures available in the initial environment return one           |
     value or, for procedures such as `apply', pass on the values             |
     returned by a call to one of their arguments.                            |

     Procedure calls are also called _combinations_.

          _Note:_ In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
          evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and
          the operand expressions are always evaluated with the same
          evaluation rules.

          _Note:_ Although the order of evaluation is otherwise
          unspecified, the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the
          operator and operand expressions is constrained to be
          consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.  The
          order of evaluation may be chosen differently for each
          procedure call.

          _Note:_ In many dialects of Lisp, the empty combination, (),
          is a legitimate expression.  In Scheme, combinations must
          have at least one subexpression, so () is not a syntactically
          valid expression.

     _Semantics:_ A lambda expression evaluates to a procedure.  The
     environment in effect when the lambda expression was evaluated is
     remembered as part of the procedure.  When the procedure is later
     called with some actual arguments, the environment in which the
     lambda expression was evaluated will be extended by binding the
     variables in the formal argument list to fresh locations, the
     corresponding actual argument values will be stored in those
     locations, and the expressions in the body of the lambda expression
     will be evaluated sequentially in the extended environment.  The
     result(s) of the last expression in the body will be returned as         |
     the result(s) of the procedure call.                                     |

     (lambda (x) (+ x x))                   ==>  __a procedure
     ((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 4)               ==>  8
     
     (define reverse-subtract
       (lambda (x y) (- y x)))
     (reverse-subtract 7 10)                ==>  3
     
     (define add4
       (let ((x 4))
         (lambda (y) (+ x y))))
     (add4 6)                               ==>  10

     <Formals> should have one of the following forms:

        * (<variable1> ...): The procedure takes a fixed number of
          arguments; when the procedure is called, the arguments will
          be stored in the bindings of the corresponding variables.

        * <variable>: The procedure takes any number of arguments; when
          the procedure is called, the sequence of actual arguments is
          converted into a newly allocated list, and the list is stored
          in the binding of the <variable>.

        * (<variable1> ... <variable_n> .  <variable_n+1>): If a              |
          space-delimited period precedes the last variable, then the
          procedure takes n or more arguments, where n is the number of       |
          formal arguments before the period (there must be at least          |
          one).  The value stored in the binding of the last variable         |
          will be a newly allocated list of the actual arguments left         |
          over after all the other actual arguments have been matched         |
          up against the other formal arguments.                              |


     It is an error for a <variable> to appear more than once in
     <formals>.

     ((lambda x x) 3 4 5 6)                 ==>  (3 4 5 6)
     ((lambda (x y . z) z)
      3 4 5 6)                              ==>  (5 6)

     Each procedure created as the result of evaluating a lambda
     expression is (conceptually) tagged with a storage location, in          |
     order to make `eqv?' and `eq?' work on procedures (see section           |
     *note Equivalence predicates::).                                         |

     _Syntax:_ <Test>, <consequent>, and <alternate> may be arbitrary
     expressions.

     _Semantics:_ An `if' expression is evaluated as follows: first,
     <test> is evaluated.  If it yields a true value (see section *note
     Booleans::), then <consequent> is evaluated and its value(s)             |

 - library syntax: cond <clause1> <clause2> ...                               |
     _Syntax:_ Each <clause> should be of the form

     (<test> <expression1> ...)                                               |

     where <test> is any expression.  Alternatively, a <clause> may be        |
     of the form                                                              |
                                                                              |
     (<test> => <expression>)                                                 |
                                                                              |
     The last <clause> may be an "else clause," which has the form            |

     (else <expression1> <expression2> ...).

     _Semantics:_ A `cond' expression is evaluated by evaluating the
     <test> expressions of successive <clause>s in order until one of
     them evaluates to a true value (see section *note Booleans::).
     When a <test> evaluates to a true value, then the remaining
     <expression>s in its <clause> are evaluated in order, and the
     result(s) of the last <expression> in the <clause> is(are)               |
     returned as the result(s) of the entire `cond' expression.  If the       |
     selected <clause> contains only the <test> and no <expression>s,         |
     then the value of the <test> is returned as the result.  If the          |
     selected <clause> uses the `=>' alternate form, then the                 |
     <expression> is evaluated.  Its value must be a procedure that           |
     accepts one argument; this procedure is then called on the value         |
     of the <test> and the value(s) returned by this procedure is(are)        |
     returned by the `cond' expression.  If all <test>s evaluate to           |
     false values, and there is no else clause, then the result of the
     conditional expression is unspecified; if there is an else clause,
     then its <expression>s are evaluated, and the value(s) of the last       |
     one is(are) returned.                                                    |

     (cond ((> 3 2) 'greater)
           ((< 3 2) 'less))                 ==>  greater
     
     (cond ((> 3 3) 'greater)
           ((< 3 3) 'less)
           (else 'equal))                   ==>  equal
                                                                              |

           (else #f))                       ==>  2


 - library syntax: case <key> <clause1> <clause2> ...                         |
     _Syntax:_ <Key> may be any expression.  Each <clause> should have
     the form

     ((<datum1> ...) <expression1> <expression2> ...),

     where each <datum> is an external representation of some object.
     All the <datum>s must be distinct.  The last <clause> may be an
     "else clause," which has the form

     (else <expression1> <expression2> ...).

     _Semantics:_ A `case' expression is evaluated as follows.  <Key> is
     evaluated and its result is compared against each <datum>.  If the
     result of evaluating <key> is equivalent (in the sense of `eqv?';
     see section *note Equivalence predicates::) to a <datum>, then the
     expressions in the corresponding <clause> are evaluated from left
     to right and the result(s) of the last expression in the <clause>        |
     is(are) returned as the result(s) of the `case' expression.  If          |
     the result of evaluating <key> is different from every <datum>,          |
     then if there is an else clause its expressions are evaluated and        |
     the result(s) of the last is(are) the result(s) of the `case'            |
     expression; otherwise the result of the `case' expression is             |
     unspecified.                                                             |

     (case (* 2 3)

     (case (car '(c d))

     (case (car '(c d))
       ((a e i o u) 'vowel)
       ((w y) 'semivowel)
       (else 'consonant))                   ==>  consonant


 - library syntax: and <test1> ...                                            |
     The <test> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and the
     value of the first expression that evaluates to a false value (see
     section *note Booleans::) is returned.  Any remaining expressions
     are not evaluated.  If all the expressions evaluate to true
     values, the value of the last expression is returned.  If there
     are no expressions then #t is returned.

     (and (= 2 2) (> 2 1))                  ==>  #t
     (and (= 2 2) (< 2 1))                  ==>  #f

 - library syntax: or <test1> ...                                             |
     The <test> expressions are evaluated from left to right, and the
     value of the first expression that evaluates to a true value (see
     section *note Booleans::) is returned.  Any remaining expressions
     are not evaluated.  If all expressions evaluate to false values,
     the value of the last expression is returned.  If there are no
     expressions then #f is returned.

     (or (= 2 2) (> 2 1))                   ==>  #t

Binding constructs
------------------

The three binding constructs `let', `let*', and `letrec' give Scheme a
block structure, like Algol 60.  The syntax of the three constructs is
identical, but they differ in the regions they establish for their
variable bindings.  In a `let' expression, the initial values are
computed before any of the variables become bound; in a `let*'
expression, the bindings and evaluations are performed sequentially;
while in a `letrec' expression, all the bindings are in effect while
their initial values are being computed, thus allowing mutually
recursive definitions.

 - library syntax: let <bindings> <body>                                      |
     _Syntax:_ <Bindings> should have the form

     ((<variable1> <init1>) ...),

     where each <init> is an expression, and <body> should be a
     sequence of one or more expressions.  It is an error for a
     <variable> to appear more than once in the list of variables being
     bound.

     _Semantics:_ The <init>s are evaluated in the current environment
     (in some unspecified order), the <variable>s are bound to fresh
     locations holding the results, the <body> is evaluated in the
     extended environment, and the value(s) of the last expression of         |
     <body> is(are) returned.  Each binding of a <variable> has <body>        |
     as its region.                                                           |

     (let ((x 2) (y 3))
       (* x y))                             ==>  6
     
     (let ((x 2) (y 3))
       (let ((x 7)
             (z (+ x y)))
         (* z x)))                          ==>  35

     See also named `let', section *Note Iteration::.


 - library syntax: let* <bindings> <body>                                     |
     _Syntax:_ <Bindings> should have the form

     ((<variable1> <init1>) ...),

     and <body> should be a sequence of one or more expressions.

     _Semantics:_ `Let*' is similar to `let', but the bindings are
     performed sequentially from left to right, and the region of a
     binding indicated by `(<variable> <init>)' is that part of the
     `let*' expression to the right of the binding.  Thus the second
     binding is done in an environment in which the first binding is
     visible, and so on.

     (let ((x 2) (y 3))
       (let* ((x 7)
              (z (+ x y)))
         (* z x)))                          ==>  70


 - library syntax: letrec <bindings> <body>                                   |
     _Syntax:_ <Bindings> should have the form

     ((<variable1> <init1>) ...),

     and <body> should be a sequence of one or more expressions. It is
     an error for a <variable> to appear more than once in the list of
     variables being bound.

     _Semantics:_ The <variable>s are bound to fresh locations holding
     undefined values, the <init>s are evaluated in the resulting
     environment (in some unspecified order), each <variable> is
     assigned to the result of the corresponding <init>, the <body> is
     evaluated in the resulting environment, and the value(s) of the          |
     last expression in <body> is(are) returned.  Each binding of a           |
     <variable> has the entire `letrec' expression as its region,             |
     making it possible to define mutually recursive procedures.              |


     (letrec ((even?
               (lambda (n)
                 (if (zero? n)
                     #t
                     (odd? (- n 1)))))
              (odd?
               (lambda (n)
                 (if (zero? n)
                     #f
                     (even? (- n 1))))))
       (even? 88))
                                            ==>  #t

     One restriction on `letrec' is very important: it must be possible
     to evaluate each <init> without assigning or referring to the
     value of any <variable>.  If this restriction is violated, then it
     is an error.  The restriction is necessary because Scheme passes
     arguments by value rather than by name.  In the most common uses
     of `letrec', all the <init>s are lambda expressions and the
     restriction is satisfied automatically.

     <expression>s.                                                           |

     `Do' expressions are evaluated as follows: The <init> expressions
     are evaluated (in some unspecified order), the <variable>s are
     bound to fresh locations, the results of the <init> expressions
     are stored in the bindings of the <variable>s, and then the
     iteration phase begins.

     Each iteration begins by evaluating <test>; if the result is false
     (see section *note Booleans::), then the <command> expressions are
     evaluated in order for effect, the <step> expressions are
     evaluated in some unspecified order, the <variable>s are bound to
     fresh locations, the results of the <step>s are stored in the
     bindings of the <variable>s, and the next iteration begins.

     If <test> evaluates to a true value, then the <expression>s are
     evaluated from left to right and the value(s) of the last                |
     <expression> is(are) returned.  If no <expression>s are present,         |
     then the value of the `do' expression is unspecified.                    |

     The region of the binding of a <variable> consists of the entire
     `do' expression except for the <init>s.  It is an error for a
     <variable> to appear more than once in the list of `do' variables.

     A <step> may be omitted, in which case the effect is the same as
     if `(<variable> <init> <variable>)' had been written instead of
     `(<variable> <init>)'.

     (do ((vec (make-vector 5))
          (i 0 (+ i 1)))
         ((= i 5) vec)
       (vector-set! vec i i))               ==>  #(0 1 2 3 4)
     
     (let ((x '(1 3 5 7 9)))
       (do ((x x (cdr x))
            (sum 0 (+ sum (car x))))
           ((null? x) sum)))                ==>  25

 - library syntax: let <variable> <bindings> <body>                           |
     "Named `let'" is a variant on the syntax of `let' which provides a       |
     more general looping construct than `do' and may also be used to         |
     express recursions.  It has the same syntax and semantics as             |
     ordinary `let' except that <variable> is bound within <body> to a        |
     procedure whose formal arguments are the bound variables and whose       |
     body is <body>.  Thus the execution of <body> may be repeated by         |
     invoking the procedure named by <variable>.                              |

     (let loop ((numbers '(3 -2 1 6 -5))
                (nonneg '())
                (neg '()))
       (cond ((null? numbers) (list nonneg neg))
             ((>= (car numbers) 0)

                    (cons (car numbers) nonneg)

Delayed evaluation
------------------

 - library syntax: delay <expression>                                         |
     The `delay' construct is used together with the procedure `force'
     to implement "lazy evaluation" or "call by need".  (delay
     <expression>) returns an object called a "promise" which at some
     point in the future may be asked (by the `force' procedure)  to
     evaluate <expression>, and deliver the resulting value.  The             |
     effect of <expression> returning multiple values is unspecified.         |

     See the description of `force' (section *note Control features::)
     for a more complete description of `delay'.

                                                                              |
Quasiquotation
--------------

 - syntax: quasiquote <qq template>                                           |
 - syntax: `<qq template>                                                     |
     "Backquote" or "quasiquote" expressions are useful for
     constructing a list or vector structure when most but not all of
     the desired structure is known in advance.  If no commas appear
     within the <qq template>, the result of evaluating `<qq template>        |
     is equivalent to the result of evaluating '<qq template>.  If a          |
     comma appears within the <qq template>, however, the expression          |
     following the comma is evaluated ("unquoted") and its result is          |
     inserted into the structure instead of the comma and the                 |
     expression.  If a comma appears followed immediately by an at-sign       |
     (@), then the following expression must evaluate to a list; the          |
     opening and closing parentheses of the list are then "stripped           |
     away" and the elements of the list are inserted in place of the          |
     comma at-sign expression sequence.  A comma at-sign should only          |
     appear within a list or vector <qq template>.                            |

     `(list ,(+ 1 2) 4)                     ==>  (list 3 4)
     (let ((name 'a)) `(list ,name ',name))
               ==>  (list a (quote a))
     `(a ,(+ 1 2) ,@(map abs '(4 -5 6)) b)
               ==>  (a 3 4 5 6 b)
     `((`foo' ,(- 10 3)) ,@(cdr '(c)) . ,(car '(cons)))                       |
               ==>  ((foo 7) . cons)
     `#(10 5 ,(sqrt 4) ,@(map sqrt '(16 9)) 8)
               ==>  #(10 5 2 4 3 8)

     Quasiquote forms may be nested.  Substitutions are made only for
     unquoted components appearing at the same nesting level as the
     outermost backquote.  The nesting level increases by one inside
     each successive quasiquotation, and decreases by one inside each
     unquotation.

     `(a `(b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo ,(+ 1 3) d) e) f)
               ==>  (a `(b ,(+ 1 2) ,(foo 4 d) e) f)
     (let ((name1 'x)
           (name2 'y))
       `(a `(b ,,name1 ,',name2 d) e))
               ==>  (a `(b ,x ,'y d) e)

     The two notations  `<qq template> and (quasiquote <qq template>)         |
     are identical in all respects.   `,<expression>' is identical to         |
     `(unquote <expression>)',  and  `,@<expression>' is identical to
     `(unquote-splicing <expression>)'.  The external syntax generated
     by `write' for two-element lists whose car is one of these symbols
     may vary between implementations.

     (quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))
               ==>  (list 3 4)
     '(quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))
               ==>  `(list ,(+ 1 2) 4)
          __i.e., (quasiquote (list (unquote (+ 1 2)) 4))

     Unpredictable behavior can result if any of the symbols
     `quasiquote', `unquote', or `unquote-splicing' appear in positions
     within a <qq template> otherwise than as described above.                |

Scheme programs can define and use new derived expression types,              |
called _macros_.  Program-defined expression types have the syntax            |
                                                                              |

     (<keyword> <datum> ...)                                                  |

where <keyword> is an identifier that uniquely determines the                 |
expression type.  This identifier is called the _syntactic keyword_, or       |
simply _keyword_, of the macro.  The number of the <datum>s, and their        |
syntax, depends on the expression type.                                       |

Each instance of a macro is called a _use_ of the macro.  The set of          |
rules that specifies how a use of a macro is transcribed into a more          |
primitive expression is called the _transformer_ of the macro.                |

The macro definition facility consists of two parts:                          |

   * A set of expressions used to establish that certain identifiers          |
     are macro keywords, associate them with macro transformers, and          |
     control the scope within which a macro is defined, and                   |

   * a pattern language for specifying macro transformers.                    |
                                                                              |

The syntactic keyword of a macro may shadow variable bindings, and local      |
variable bindings may shadow keyword bindings.    All macros defined          |
using the pattern language  are "hygienic" and "referentially                 |
transparent" and thus preserve Scheme's lexical scoping [Kohlbecker86],       |
[ hygienic], [Bawden88], [macrosthatwork], [syntacticabstraction]:            |

   * If a macro transformer inserts a binding for an identifier               |
     (variable or keyword), the identifier will in effect be renamed          |
     throughout its scope to avoid conflicts with other identifiers.          |
     Note that a `define' at top level may or may not introduce a             |
     binding; see section *Note Definitions::.                                |

   * If a macro transformer inserts a free reference to an identifier,        |
     the reference refers to the binding that was visible where the           |
     transformer was specified, regardless of any local bindings that         |
     may surround the use of the macro.                                       |
                                                                              |

Binding constructs for syntactic keywords                                     |
-----------------------------------------                                     |

`Let-syntax' and `letrec-syntax' are analogous to `let' and `letrec',         |
but they bind syntactic keywords to macro transformers instead of             |
binding variables to locations that contain values.  Syntactic keywords       |
may also be bound at top level; see section *Note Syntax definitions::.       |

 - syntax: let-syntax <bindings> <body>                                       |
     _Syntax:_ <Bindings> should have the form                                |

     ((<keyword> <transformer spec>) ...)                                     |

     Each <keyword> is an identifier, each <transformer spec> is an           |
     instance of `syntax-rules', and <body> should be a sequence of one       |
     or more expressions.  It is an error for a <keyword> to appear           |
     more than once in the list of keywords being bound.                      |

     _Semantics:_ The <body> is expanded in the syntactic environment         |
     obtained by extending the syntactic environment of the                   |
     `let-syntax' expression with macros whose keywords are the               |
     <keyword>s, bound to the specified transformers.  Each binding of        |
     a <keyword> has <body> as its region.                                    |

     _Syntax:_ Same as for `let-syntax'.                                      |

     _Semantics:_  The <body> is expanded in the syntactic environment        |
     obtained by extending the syntactic environment of the                   |
     `letrec-syntax' expression with macros whose keywords are the            |
     <keyword>s, bound to the specified transformers.  Each binding of        |
     a <keyword> has the <bindings> as well as the <body> within its          |
     region, so the transformers can transcribe expressions into uses         |
     of the macros introduced by the `letrec-syntax' expression.              |

     (letrec-syntax                                                           |

----------------                                                              |

A <transformer spec> has the following form:                                  |

 - : syntax-rules <literals> <syntax rule> ...                                |
     _Syntax:_ <Literals> is a list of identifiers and each <syntax           |
     rule> should be of the form                                              |

     (<pattern> <template>)                                                   |

     The <pattern> in a <syntax rule> is a list <pattern> that begins         |
     with the keyword for the macro.                                          |

     A <pattern> is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the           |
     following                                                                |

     (<pattern> ...)                                                          |
     (<pattern> <pattern> ... . <pattern>)                                    |
     (<pattern> ... <pattern> <ellipsis>)                                     |
     #(<pattern> ...)                                                         |
     #(<pattern> ... <pattern> <ellipsis>)                                    |
                                                                              |
     and a template is either an identifier, a constant, or one of the        |
     following                                                                |
                                                                              |
     (<element> ...)                                                          |
     (<element> <element> ... . <template>)                                   |
     #(<element> ...)                                                         |
                                                                              |
     where an <element> is a <template> optionally followed by an             |
     <ellipsis> and an <ellipsis> is the identifier "`...'" (which            |
     cannot be used as an identifier in either a template or a pattern).      |

     _Semantics:_ An instance of `syntax-rules' produces a new macro          |
     transformer by specifying a sequence of hygienic rewrite rules.  A       |
     use of a macro whose keyword is associated with a transformer            |
     specified by `syntax-rules' is matched against the patterns              |
     contained in the <syntax rule>s, beginning with the leftmost             |
     <syntax rule>.  When a match is found, the macro use is                  |
     transcribed hygienically according to the template.                      |

     An identifier that appears in the pattern of a <syntax rule> is a        |
     _pattern variable_, unless it is the keyword that begins the             |
     pattern, is listed in <literals>, or is the identifier "`...'".          |
     Pattern variables match arbitrary input elements and are used to         |
     refer to elements of the input in the template.  It is an error          |
     for the same pattern variable to appear more than once in a              |
     <pattern>.                                                               |

     The keyword at the beginning of the pattern in a <syntax rule> is        |
     not involved in the matching and is not considered a pattern             |
     variable or literal identifier.                                          |

          _Rationale:_ The scope of the keyword is determined by the          |
          expression or syntax definition that binds it to the                |
          associated macro transformer.  If the keyword were a pattern        |
          variable or literal identifier, then the template that              |
          follows the pattern would be within its scope regardless of         |
          whether the keyword were bound by `let-syntax' or by                |
          `letrec-syntax'.                                                    |

     Identifiers that appear in <literals> are interpreted as literal         |
     identifiers to be matched against corresponding subforms of the          |
     input.  A subform in the input matches a literal identifier if and       |
     only if it is an identifier and either both its occurrence in the        |
     macro expression and its occurrence in the macro definition have         |
     the same lexical binding, or the two identifiers are equal and           |
     both have no lexical binding.                                            |

     A subpattern followed by `...' can match zero or more elements of        |
     the input.  It is an error for `...' to appear in <literals>.            |
     Within a pattern the identifier `...' must follow the last element       |
     of a nonempty sequence of subpatterns.                                   |

     More formally, an input form F matches a pattern P if and only if:       |

        * P is a non-literal identifier; or                                   |

        * P is a literal identifier and F is an identifier with the same      |
          binding; or                                                         |

        * P is a list `(P_1 ... P_n)' and F is a list of n forms that         |
          match P_1 through P_n, respectively; or                             |

        * P is an improper list `(P_1 P_2 ... P_n . P_n+1)' and F is a        |
          list or improper list of n or more forms that match P_1             |
          through P_n, respectively, and whose nth "cdr" matches P_n+1;       |
          or                                                                  |

        * P is of the form `(P_1 ... P_n P_n+1 <ellipsis>)' where             |
          <ellipsis> is the identifier `...' and F is a proper list of        |
          at least n forms, the first n of which match P_1 through P_n,       |
          respectively, and each remaining element of F matches P_n+1;        |
          or                                                                  |
                                                                              |
        * P is a vector of the form `#(P_1 ... P_n)' and F is a vector        |
          of n forms that match P_1 through P_n; or                           |
                                                                              |
        * P is of the form `#(P_1 ... P_n P_n+1 <ellipsis>)' where            |
          <ellipsis> is the identifier `...' and F is a vector of n or        |
          more forms the first n of which match P_1 through P_n,              |
          respectively, and each remaining element of F matches P_n+1;        |
          or                                                                  |

        * P is a datum and F is equal to P in the sense of the `equal?'       |
          procedure.                                                          |
                                                                              |

     It is an error to use a macro keyword, within the scope of its           |
     binding, in an expression that does not match any of the patterns.       |
                                                                              |
     When a macro use is transcribed according to the template of the         |
     matching <syntax rule>, pattern variables that occur in the              |
     template are replaced by the subforms they match in the input.           |
     Pattern variables that occur in subpatterns followed by one or more      |
     instances of the identifier `...' are allowed only in subtemplates       |
     that are followed by as many instances of `...'.  They are               |
     replaced in the output by all of the subforms they match in the          |
     input, distributed as indicated.  It is an error if the output           |
     cannot be built up as specified.                                         |
                                                                              |
     Identifiers that appear in the template but are not pattern              |
     variables or the identifier `...' are inserted into the output as        |
     literal identifiers.  If a literal identifier is inserted as a           |
     free identifier then it refers to the binding of that identifier         |
     within whose scope the instance of `syntax-rules' appears.  If a         |
     literal identifier is inserted as a bound identifier then it is in       |
     effect renamed to prevent inadvertent captures of free identifiers.      |
                                                                              |
     As an example, if `let' and `cond' are defined as in section *Note       |
     Derived expression type:: then they are hygienic (as required) and       |
     the following is not an error.                                           |
                                                                              |
     (let ((=> #f))                                                           |
       (cond (#t => 'ok)))                  ==> ok                            |
                                                                              |
     The macro transformer for `cond' recognizes `=>' as a local              |
     variable, and hence an expression, and not as the top-level              |
     identifier `=>', which the macro transformer treats as a syntactic       |
     keyword.  Thus the example expands into                                  |
                                                                              |
     (let ((=> #f))                                                           |
       (if #t (begin => 'ok)))                                                |
                                                                              |
     instead of                                                               |
                                                                              |
     (let ((=> #f))                                                           |
       (let ((temp #t))                                                       |
         (if temp ('ok temp))))                                               |
                                                                              |
     which would result in an invalid procedure call.                         |
                                                                              |

========

A Scheme program consists of a sequence of expressions, definitions,          |
and syntax definitions.  Expressions are described in chapter *Note           |
Expressions::; definitions and syntax definitions are the subject of          |
the rest of the present chapter.                                              |

Programs are typically stored in files or entered interactively to a          |
running Scheme system, although other paradigms are possible; questions       |
of user interface lie outside the scope of this report.  (Indeed,             |
Scheme would still be useful as a notation for expressing computational       |
methods even in the absence of a mechanical implementation.)                  |

Definitions and syntax definitions occurring at the top level of a            |
program can be interpreted declaratively.  They cause bindings to be          |
created in the top level environment or modify the value of existing          |
top-level bindings.  Expressions occurring at the top level of a              |
program are interpreted imperatively; they are executed in order when         |
the program is invoked or loaded, and typically perform some kind of          |
initialization.                                                               |
                                                                              |
At the top level of a program (begin <form1> ...) is equivalent to the        |
sequence of expressions, definitions, and syntax definitions that form        |

Definitions are valid in some, but not all, contexts where expressions        |
are allowed.  They are valid only at the top level of a <program> and         |
at the beginning of a <body>.                                                 |

A definition should have one of the following forms:                          |

   * (define <variable> <expression>)                                         |

   * (define (<variable> <formals>) <body>)                                   |
                                                                              |
     <Formals> should be either a sequence of zero or more variables,         |
     or a sequence of one or more variables followed by a                     |
     space-delimited period and another variable (as in a lambda              |
     expression).  This form is equivalent to                                 |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
          (define <variable>                                                  |
            (lambda (<formals>) <body>)).                                     |
                                                                              |
   * (define (<variable> . <formal>) <body>)                                  |
                                                                              |
     <Formal> should be a single variable.  This form is equivalent to        |
                                                                              |

has essentially the same effect as the assignment expression                  |
                                                                              |

     (set! <variable> <expression>)                                           |

if <variable> is bound.  If <variable> is not bound, however, then the        |
definition will bind <variable> to a new location before performing the       |
assignment, whereas it would be an error to perform a `set!' on an            |
unbound variable.                                                             |

Some implementations of Scheme use an initial environment in which all        |
possible variables are bound to locations, most of which contain              |
undefined values.  Top level definitions in such an implementation are        |
truly equivalent to assignments.                                              |

Internal definitions                                                          |
--------------------                                                          |
                                                                              |
Definitions may occur at the beginning of a <body> (that is, the body         |
of a `lambda', `let', `let*', `letrec', `let-syntax', or `letrec-syntax'      |
expression or that of a definition of an appropriate form).  Such             |
definitions are known as _internal definitions_  as opposed to the top        |
level definitions described above.  The variable defined by an internal       |
definition is local to the <body>.  That is, <variable> is bound rather       |
than assigned, and the region of the binding is the entire <body>.  For       |
example,                                                                      |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
     (let ((x 5))                                                             |
       (define foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))                                    |
       (define bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a)))                              |
       (foo (+ x 3)))                       ==>  45                           |
                                                                              |
A <body> containing internal definitions can always be converted into a       |
completely equivalent `letrec' expression.  For example, the `let'            |
expression in the above example is equivalent to                              |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
     (let ((x 5))                                                             |
       (letrec ((foo (lambda (y) (bar x y)))                                  |
                (bar (lambda (a b) (+ (* a b) a))))                           |
         (foo (+ x 3))))                                                      |
                                                                              |
Just as for the equivalent `letrec' expression, it must be possible to        |
evaluate each <expression> of every internal definition in a <body>           |
without assigning or referring to the value of any <variable> being           |
defined.                                                                      |
                                                                              |
Wherever an internal definition may occur (begin <definition1> ...)  is       |
equivalent to the sequence of definitions that form the body of the           |
`begin'.                                                                      |

                                                                              |
Syntax definitions are valid only at the top level of a <program>.            |
                                                                              |
They have the following form:                                                 |
                                                                              |
(define-syntax <keyword> <transformer spec>)                                  |
                                                                              |
<Keyword> is an identifier, and the <transformer spec> should be an           |
instance of `syntax-rules'.  The top-level syntactic environment is           |
extended by binding the <keyword> to the specified transformer.               |
                                                                              |
There is no `define-syntax' analogue of internal definitions.                 |
                                                                              |
Although macros may expand into definitions and syntax definitions in         |
any context that permits them, it is an error for a definition or syntax      |
definition to shadow a syntactic keyword whose meaning is needed to           |
determine whether some form in the group of forms that contains the           |
shadowing definition is in fact a definition, or, for internal                |
definitions, is needed to determine the boundary between the group and        |
the expressions that follow the group.  For example, the following are        |
errors:                                                                       |

This chapter describes Scheme's built-in procedures.  The initial (or         |
"top level") Scheme environment starts out with a number of variables         |
bound to locations containing useful values, most of which are primitive      |
procedures that manipulate data.  For example, the variable `abs' is          |
bound to (a location initially containing) a procedure of one argument        |
that computes the absolute value of a number, and the variable `+' is         |
bound to a procedure that computes sums.  Built-in procedures that can        |
easily be written in terms of other built-in procedures are identified        |
as "library procedures".                                                      |
                                                                              |
A program may use a top-level definition to bind any variable.  It may        |
subsequently alter any such binding by an assignment (see *note               |
Assignments::).  These operations do not modify the behavior of               |
Scheme's built-in procedures.  Altering any top-level binding that has        |
not been introduced by a definition has an unspecified effect on the          |
behavior of the built-in procedures.                                          |

Equivalence predicates
======================

A "predicate" is a procedure that always returns a boolean value (#t or
#f).  An "equivalence predicate" is the computational analogue of a
mathematical equivalence relation (it is symmetric, reflexive, and
transitive).  Of the equivalence predicates described in this section,
`eq?' is the finest or most discriminating, and `equal?' is the
coarsest.  `Eqv?' is slightly less discriminating than `eq?'.

 - procedure: eqv? obj1 obj2                                                  |
     The `eqv?' procedure defines a useful equivalence relation on
     objects.  Briefly, it returns #t if OBJ1 and OBJ2 should normally
     be regarded as the same object.  This relation is left slightly
     open to interpretation, but the following partial specification of
     `eqv?' holds for all implementations of Scheme.

     The `eqv?' procedure returns #t if:

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are both #t or both #f.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are both symbols and

          (string=? (symbol->string obj1)
                    (symbol->string obj2))
                                            ==>  #t

               _Note:_ This assumes that neither OBJ1 nor OBJ2 is an
               "uninterned symbol" as alluded to in section *Note
               Symbols::.  This report does not presume to specify the
               behavior of `eqv?' on implementation-dependent
               extensions.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are both numbers, are numerically equal (see
          `=', section *note Numbers::), and are either both exact or
          both inexact.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are both characters and are the same character
          according to the `char=?' procedure (section *note
          Characters::).

        * both OBJ1 and OBJ2 are the empty list.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are pairs, vectors, or strings that denote the
          same locations in the store (section *note Storage model::).

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are procedures whose location tags are equal
          (section *note Procedures::).                                       |


     The `eqv?' procedure returns #f if:

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are of different types (section *note
          Disjointness of types::).

        * one of OBJ1 and OBJ2 is #t but the other is #f.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are symbols but

          (string=? (symbol->string OBJ1)
                    (symbol->string OBJ2))
                                            ==>  #f

        * one of OBJ1 and OBJ2 is an exact number but the other is an
          inexact number.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are numbers for which the `=' procedure returns
          #f.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are characters for which the `char=?' procedure
          returns #f.

        * one of OBJ1 and OBJ2 is the empty list but the other is not.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are pairs, vectors, or strings that denote
          distinct locations.

        * OBJ1 and OBJ2 are procedures that would behave differently
          (return different value(s) or have different side effects)          |
          for some arguments.                                                 |


     (eqv? 'a 'a)                           ==>  #t
     (eqv? 'a 'b)                           ==>  #f
     (eqv? 2 2)                             ==>  #t
     (eqv? '() '())                         ==>  #t
     (eqv? 100000000 100000000)             ==>  #t
     (eqv? (cons 1 2) (cons 1 2))           ==>  #f
     (eqv? (lambda () 1)
           (lambda () 2))                   ==>  #f
     (eqv? #f 'nil)                         ==>  #f
     (let ((p (lambda (x) x)))
       (eqv? p p))                          ==>  #t

     The following examples illustrate cases in which the above rules do
     not fully specify the behavior of `eqv?'.  All that can be said
     about such cases is that the value returned by `eqv?' must be a
     boolean.

     (eqv? "" "")                           ==>  _unspecified_
     (eqv? '#() '#())                       ==>  _unspecified_
     (eqv? (lambda (x) x)
           (lambda (x) x))                  ==>  _unspecified_
     (eqv? (lambda (x) x)
           (lambda (y) y))                  ==>  _unspecified_

     The next set of examples shows the use of `eqv?' with procedures
     that have local state.  `Gen-counter' must return a distinct
     procedure every time, since each procedure has its own internal
     counter.  `Gen-loser', however, returns equivalent procedures each
     time, since the local state does not affect the value or side
     effects of the procedures.

     (define gen-counter
       (lambda ()
         (let ((n 0))
           (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) n))))
     (let ((g (gen-counter)))
       (eqv? g g))                          ==>  #t
     (eqv? (gen-counter) (gen-counter))
                                            ==>  #f
     (define gen-loser
       (lambda ()
         (let ((n 0))
           (lambda () (set! n (+ n 1)) 27))))
     (let ((g (gen-loser)))
       (eqv? g g))                          ==>  #t
     (eqv? (gen-loser) (gen-loser))
                                            ==>  _unspecified_
     
     (letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'f)))
              (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'both 'g))))                       |
       (eqv? f g))                                                            |
                                            ==>  _unspecified_
     
     (letrec ((f (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'f 'both)))
              (g (lambda () (if (eqv? f g) 'g 'both))))                       |
       (eqv? f g))                                                            |
                                            ==>  #f

     Since it is an error to modify constant objects (those returned by
     literal expressions), implementations are permitted, though not
     required, to share structure between constants where appropriate.
     Thus the value of `eqv?' on constants is sometimes
     implementation-dependent.

     (eqv? '(a) '(a))                       ==>  _unspecified_
     (eqv? "a" "a")                         ==>  _unspecified_
     (eqv? '(b) (cdr '(a b)))               ==>  _unspecified_
     (let ((x '(a)))
       (eqv? x x))                          ==>  #t

          _Rationale:_ The above definition of `eqv?' allows
          implementations latitude in their treatment of procedures and
          literals:  implementations are free either to detect or to
          fail to detect that two procedures or two literals are
          equivalent to each other, and can decide whether or not to
          merge representations of equivalent objects by using the same
          pointer or bit pattern to represent both.


 - procedure: eq? obj1 obj2                                                   |
     `Eq?' is similar to `eqv?' except that in some cases it is capable
     of discerning distinctions finer than those detectable by `eqv?'.

     `Eq?' and `eqv?' are guaranteed to have the same behavior on
     symbols, booleans, the empty list, pairs, procedures, and non-empty      |
     strings and vectors.  `Eq?''s behavior on numbers and characters is      |
     implementation-dependent, but it will always return either true or
     false, and will return true only when `eqv?' would also return
     true.  `Eq?' may also behave differently from `eqv?' on empty
     vectors and empty strings.

     (eq? 'a 'a)                            ==>  #t
     (eq? '(a) '(a))                        ==>  _unspecified_
     (eq? (list 'a) (list 'a))              ==>  #f
     (eq? "a" "a")                          ==>  _unspecified_
     (eq? "" "")                            ==>  _unspecified_
     (eq? '() '())                          ==>  #t
     (eq? 2 2)                              ==>  _unspecified_
     (eq? #\A #\A)                          ==>  _unspecified_
     (eq? car car)                          ==>  #t
     (let ((n (+ 2 3)))
       (eq? n n))                           ==>  _unspecified_
     (let ((x '(a)))
       (eq? x x))                           ==>  #t
     (let ((x '#()))
       (eq? x x))                           ==>  #t
     (let ((p (lambda (x) x)))
       (eq? p p))                           ==>  #t

          _Rationale:_ It will usually be possible to implement `eq?'
          much more efficiently than `eqv?', for example, as a simple
          pointer comparison instead of as some more complicated
          operation.  One reason is that it may not be possible to
          compute `eqv?' of two numbers in constant time, whereas `eq?'
          implemented as pointer comparison will always finish in
          constant time.  `Eq?' may be used like `eqv?' in applications
          using procedures to implement objects with state since it
          obeys the same constraints as `eqv?'.


 - library procedure: equal? obj1 obj2                                        |
     `Equal?' recursively compares the contents of pairs, vectors, and
     strings, applying `eqv?' on other objects such as numbers and
     symbols.  A rule of thumb is that objects are generally `equal?'
     if they print the same.  `Equal?' may fail to terminate if its
     arguments are circular data structures.

     (equal? 'a 'a)                         ==>  #t
     (equal? '(a) '(a))                     ==>  #t
     (equal? '(a (b) c)
             '(a (b) c))                    ==>  #t
     (equal? "abc" "abc")                   ==>  #t
     (equal? 2 2)                           ==>  #t
     (equal? (make-vector 5 'a)
             (make-vector 5 'a))            ==>  #t
     (equal? (lambda (x) x)
             (lambda (y) y))                ==>  _unspecified_

Numerical computation has traditionally been neglected by the Lisp            |
community.  Until Common Lisp there was no carefully thought out              |
strategy for organizing numerical computation, and with the exception of      |
the MacLisp system [Pitman83] little effort was made to execute               |
numerical code efficiently.  This report recognizes the excellent work        |
of the Common Lisp committee and accepts many of their recommendations.       |
In some ways this report simplifies and generalizes their proposals in        |
a manner consistent with the purposes of Scheme.                              |

It is important to distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the          |
Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations        |
used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write             |
numbers.  This report uses the types number, complex, real, rational,         |
and integer to refer to both mathematical numbers and Scheme numbers.         |
Machine representations such as fixed point and floating point are            |
referred to by names such as fixnum and flonum.                               |

Mathematically, numbers may be arranged into a tower of subtypes in           |
which each level is a subset of the level above it:                           |

         number                                                               |
          complex                                                             |
          real                                                                |
          rational                                                            |
          integer                                                             |

For example, 3 is an integer.  Therefore 3 is also a rational, a real,        |
and a complex.  The same is true of the Scheme numbers that model 3.          |
For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the predicates                 |
`number?', `complex?', `real?', `rational?', and `integer?'.                  |

There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its               |
representation inside a computer.  Although most implementations of           |
Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these          |
different representations denote the same integer.                            |

Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as              |
independent of their representation as possible.  Although an                 |
implementation of Scheme may use fixnum, flonum, and perhaps other            |
representations for numbers, this should not be apparent to a casual          |
programmer writing simple programs.                                           |

It is necessary, however, to distinguish between numbers that are             |
represented exactly and those that may not be.  For example, indexes          |
into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial           |
coefficients in a symbolic algebra system.  On the other hand, the            |
results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers        |
may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations.         |
In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are             |
required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers.         |
This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.                      |

Exactness                                                                     |
---------                                                                     |

Scheme numbers are either exact or inexact.  A number is exact if it          |
was written as an exact constant or was derived from exact numbers            |
using only exact operations.  A number is inexact if it was written as        |
an inexact constant, if it was derived using inexact ingredients, or if       |
it was derived using inexact operations. Thus inexactness is a                |
contagious property of a number.                                              |

If two implementations produce exact results for a computation that did       |
not involve inexact intermediate results, the two ultimate results will       |
be mathematically equivalent.  This is generally not true of                  |
computations involving inexact numbers since approximate methods such         |
as floating point arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each          |
implementation to make the result as close as practical to the                |
mathematically ideal result.                                                  |

Rational operations such as `+' should always produce exact results           |
when given exact arguments.  If the operation is unable to produce an         |
exact result, then it may either report the violation of an                   |
implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an         |
inexact value.  See section *Note Implementation restrictions::.              |

With the exception of `inexact->exact', the operations described in           |
this section must generally return inexact results when given any             |
inexact arguments.  An operation may, however, return an exact result         |
if it can prove that the value of the result is unaffected by the             |
inexactness of its arguments.  For example, multiplication of any             |
number by an exact zero may produce an exact zero result, even if the         |
other argument is inexact.                                                    |

Implementation restrictions                                                   |
---------------------------                                                   |

Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole tower       |
of subtypes given in section *Note Numerical types::, but they must           |
implement a coherent subset consistent with both the purposes of the          |
implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language.  For example, an        |
implementation in which all numbers are real may still be quite useful.       |

Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of any       |
type, subject to the requirements of this section.  The supported range       |
for exact numbers of any type may be different from the supported range       |
for inexact numbers of that type.  For example, an implementation that        |
uses flonums to represent all its inexact real numbers may support a          |
practically unbounded range of exact integers and rationals while             |
limiting the range of inexact reals (and therefore the range of inexact       |
integers and rationals) to the dynamic range of the flonum format.            |
Furthermore the gaps between the representable inexact integers and           |
rationals are likely to be very large in such an implementation as the        |
limits of this range are approached.                                          |

An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers throughout the        |
range of numbers that may be used for indexes of lists, vectors, and          |
strings or that may result from computing the length of a list, vector,       |
or string.  The `length', `vector-length', and `string-length'                |
procedures must return an exact integer, and it is an error to use            |
anything but an exact integer as an index.  Furthermore any integer           |
constant within the index range, if expressed by an exact integer             |
syntax, will indeed be read as an exact integer, regardless of any            |
implementation restrictions that may apply outside this range.                |
Finally, the procedures listed below will always return an exact              |
integer result provided all their arguments are exact integers and the        |
mathematically expected result is representable as an exact integer           |
within the implementation:                                                    |
                                                                              |

     +            -             *                                             |
     quotient     remainder     modulo                                        |
     max          min           abs                                           |
     numerator    denominator   gcd                                           |
     lcm          floor         ceiling                                       |
     truncate     round         rationalize                                   |
     expt                                                                     |

Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to support exact            |
integers and exact rationals of practically unlimited size and                |
precision, and to implement the above procedures and the `/' procedure        |
in such a way that they always return exact results when given exact          |
arguments.  If one of these procedures is unable to deliver an exact          |
result when given exact arguments, then it may either report a                |
violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently coerce          |
its result to an inexact number.  Such a coercion may cause an error          |
later.                                                                        |

An implementation may use floating point and other approximate                |
representation strategies for inexact numbers.                                |

This report recommends, but does not require, that the IEEE 32-bit and        |
64-bit floating point standards be followed by implementations that use       |
flonum representations, and that implementations using other                  |
representations should match or exceed the precision achievable using         |
these floating point standards [IEEE].                                        |

In particular, implementations that use flonum representations must           |
follow these rules: A flonum result must be represented with at least         |
as much precision as is used to express any of the inexact arguments to       |
that operation.  It is desirable (but not required) for potentially           |
inexact operations such as `sqrt', when applied to exact arguments, to        |
produce exact answers whenever possible (for example the square root of       |
an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2).  If, however, an exact number is          |
operated upon so as to produce an inexact result (as by `sqrt'), and if       |
the result is represented as a flonum, then the most precise flonum           |
format available must be used; but if the result is represented in some       |
other way then the representation must have at least as much precision        |
as the most precise flonum format available.                                  |

Although Scheme allows a variety of written notations for numbers, any        |
particular implementation may support only some of them.  For example,        |
an implementation in which all numbers are real need not support the          |
rectangular and polar notations for complex numbers.  If an                   |
implementation encounters an exact numerical constant that it cannot          |
represent as an exact number, then it may either report a violation of        |
an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the constant       |
by an inexact number.                                                         |

-----------------------------                                                 |

The syntax of the written representations for numbers is described            |
formally in section *Note Lexical structure::.  Note that case is not         |
significant in numerical constants.                                           |

A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal by          |
the use of a radix prefix.  The radix prefixes are `#b' (binary), `#o'        |
(octal), `#d' (decimal), and `#x' (hexadecimal).  With no radix prefix,       |
a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.                               |

A numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or inexact by        |
a prefix.  The prefixes are `#e' for exact, and `#i' for inexact.  An         |
exactness prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is          |
used.  If the written representation of a number has no exactness             |
prefix, the constant may be either inexact or exact.  It is inexact if        |
it contains a decimal point, an exponent, or a "#" character in the           |
place of a digit, otherwise it is exact.                                      |

In systems with inexact numbers of varying precisions it may be useful        |
to specify the precision of a constant.  For this purpose, numerical          |
constants may be written with an exponent marker that indicates the           |
desired precision of the inexact representation.  The letters `s', `f',       |
`d', and `l' specify the use of SHORT, SINGLE, DOUBLE, and LONG               |
precision, respectively.  (When fewer than four internal inexact              |
representations exist, the four size specifications are mapped onto           |
those available.  For example, an implementation with two internal            |
representations may map short and single together and long and double         |
together.)  In addition, the exponent marker `e' specifies the default        |
precision for the implementation.  The default precision has at least         |
as much precision as DOUBLE, but implementations may wish to allow this       |
default to be set by the user.                                                |

The reader is referred to section *Note Entry format:: for a summary of       |
the naming conventions used to specify restrictions on the types of           |
arguments to numerical routines.                                              |

The examples used in this section assume that any numerical constant          |
written using an exact notation is indeed represented as an exact             |
number.  Some examples also assume that certain numerical constants           |
written using an inexact notation can be represented without loss of          |
accuracy; the inexact constants were chosen so that this is likely to         |
be true in implementations that use flonums to represent inexact              |
numbers.                                                                      |

     These numerical type predicates can be applied to any kind of            |
     argument, including non-numbers.  They return #t if the object is        |
     of the named type, and otherwise they return #f.  In general, if a       |
     type predicate is true of a number then all higher type predicates       |
     are also true of that number.  Consequently, if a type predicate         |
     is false of a number, then all lower type predicates are also            |
     false of that number.                                                    |

     If Z is an inexact complex number, then `(real? Z)' is true if and       |
     only if `(zero? (imag-part Z))' is true.  If X is an inexact real        |
     number, then `(integer? X)' is true if and only if `(= X (round          |
     X))'.                                                                    |

          _Note:_ The behavior of these type predicates on inexact            |
          numbers is unreliable, since any inaccuracy may affect the          |
          result.                                                             |

          _Note:_ In many implementations the `rational?' procedure           |
          will be the same as `real?', and the `complex?' procedure           |
          will be the same as `number?', but unusual implementations          |
          may be able to represent some irrational numbers exactly or         |
          may extend the number system to support some kind of                |
          non-complex numbers.                                                |

     These numerical predicates provide tests for the exactness of a          |
     quantity.  For any Scheme number, precisely one of these predicates      |
     is true.                                                                 |

     These procedures return #t if their arguments are (respectively):        |
     equal, monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing,               |
     monotonically nondecreasing, or monotonically nonincreasing.             |

     These predicates are required to be transitive.                          |

          _Note:_ The traditional implementations of these predicates         |
          in Lisp-like languages are not transitive.                          |

          _Note:_ While it is not an error to compare inexact numbers         |
          using these predicates, the results may be unreliable because       |
          a small inaccuracy may affect the result; this is especially        |
          true of `=' and `zero?'.  When in doubt, consult a numerical        |
          analyst.                                                            |
                                                                              |

     These numerical predicates test a number for a particular property,      |
     returning #t or #f.  See note above.                                     |
                                                                              |

 - library procedure: min x1 x2 ...                                           |
     These procedures return the maximum or minimum of their arguments.       |

     (max 3 4)                              ==>  4    ; exact                 |

          _Note:_ If any argument is inexact, then the result will also       |
          be inexact (unless the procedure can prove that the                 |
          inaccuracy is not large enough to affect the result, which is       |
          possible only in unusual implementations).  If `min' or `max'       |
          is used to compare numbers of mixed exactness, and the              |
          numerical value of the result cannot be represented as an           |
          inexact number without loss of accuracy, then the procedure         |
          may report a violation of an implementation restriction.            |
                                                                              |

     With two or more arguments, these procedures return the difference       |
     or quotient of their arguments, associating to the left.  With one       |
     argument, however, they return the additive or multiplicative            |
     inverse of their argument.                                               |

     These procedures implement number-theoretic (integer) division.          |
     N2 should be non-zero.  All three procedures return integers.  If        |

     has the same sign as N1, and N_M has the same sign as N2.                |

     From this we can conclude that for integers N1 and N2 with N2 not        |

     These procedures return integers.  `Floor' returns the largest           |
     integer not larger than X.  `Ceiling' returns the smallest integer       |
     not smaller than X.  `Truncate' returns the integer closest to X         |
     whose absolute value is not larger than the absolute value of X.         |
     `Round' returns the closest integer to X, rounding to even when X        |
     is halfway between two integers.                                         |

          _Rationale:_ `Round' rounds to even for consistency with the        |
          default rounding mode specified by the IEEE floating point          |
          standard.                                                           |

          _Note:_ If the argument to one of these procedures is               |
          inexact, then the result will also be inexact.  If an exact         |
          value is needed, the result should be passed to the                 |
          `inexact->exact' procedure.                                         |

     (floor -4.3)                           ==>  -5.0                         |

 - library procedure: rationalize x y                                         |
     `Rationalize' returns the _simplest_ rational number differing           |
     from X by no more than Y.  A rational number r_1 is _simpler_            |
     than another rational number r_2 if r_1 = p_1/q_1 and r_2 =              |
     p_2/q_2 (in lowest terms) and |p_1|<= |p_2| and |q_1| <= |q_2|.          |
     Thus 3/5 is simpler than 4/7.  Although not all rationals are            |
     comparable in this ordering (consider 2/7 and 3/5) any interval          |
     contains a rational number that is simpler than every other              |
     rational number in that interval (the simpler 2/5 lies between 2/7       |
     and 3/5).  Note that 0 = 0/1 is the simplest rational of all.            |

     These procedures are part of every implementation that supports          |
     general real numbers; they compute the usual transcendental              |
     functions.  `Log' computes the natural logarithm of Z (not the           |
     base ten logarithm).  `Asin', `acos', and `atan' compute arcsine         |
     (sin^-1), arccosine (cos^-1), and arctangent (tan^-1),                   |
     respectively.  The two-argument variant of `atan' computes (angle        |
     (make-rectangular X Y)) (see below), even in implementations that        |
     don't support general complex numbers.                                   |

     In general, the mathematical functions log, arcsine, arccosine, and      |
     arctangent are multiply defined.  The value of log z is defined to       |
     be the one whose imaginary part lies in the range from -pi               |
     (exclusive) to pi (inclusive).  log 0 is undefined.  With log            |
     defined this way, the values of sin^-1 z, cos^-1 z, and tan^-1 z         |
     are according to the following formulae:                                 |

                   sin^-1 z = -i log (i z + sqrt1 - z^2)                      |

                        cos^-1 z = pi / 2 - sin^-1 z                          |

             tan^-1 z = (log (1 + i z) - log (1 - i z)) / (2 i)               |

     The above specification follows [CLtL], which in turn cites              |
     [Penfield81]; refer to these sources for more detailed discussion        |
     of branch cuts, boundary conditions, and implementation of these         |
     functions.  When it is possible these procedures produce a real          |
     result from a real argument.                                             |


 - procedure: sqrt Z                                                          |
     Returns the principal square root of Z.  The result will have            |
     either positive real part, or zero real part and non-negative            |
     imaginary part.                                                          |

 - procedure: expt z1 z2                                                      |

                          z_1^z_2 = e^z_2 log z_1                             |

     These procedures are part of every implementation that supports          |
     general complex numbers.  Suppose X1, X2, X3, and X4 are real            |
     numbers and Z is a complex number such that                              |

                         Z = X1 + X2i = X3 . e^i X4                           |

     Then                                                                     |

     (real-part Z)                          ==> X1                            |
     (imag-part Z)                          ==> X2                            |
     (magnitude Z)                          ==> |X3|                          |
     (angle Z)                              ==> x_angle                       |

     where -pi < x_angle <= pi with x_angle = X4 + 2pi n for some             |
     integer n.                                                               |

          _Rationale:_ `Magnitude' is the same as `abs' for a real            |
          argument, but `abs' must be present in all implementations,         |
          whereas `magnitude' need only be present in implementations         |
          that support general complex numbers.                               |
                                                                              |

     `Exact->inexact' returns an inexact representation of Z.  The            |
     value returned is the inexact number that is numerically closest         |
     to the argument.  If an exact argument has no reasonably close           |
     inexact equivalent, then a violation of an implementation                |
     restriction may be reported.                                             |

     `Inexact->exact' returns an exact representation of Z.  The value        |
     returned is the exact number that is numerically closest to the          |
     argument.  If an inexact argument has no reasonably close exact          |
     equivalent, then a violation of an implementation restriction may        |
     be reported.                                                             |

     These procedures implement the natural one-to-one correspondence         |
     between exact and inexact integers throughout an                         |
     implementation-dependent range.  See section *Note Implementation
     restrictions::.                                                          |

     RADIX must be an exact integer, either 2, 8, 10, or 16.  If              |
     omitted, RADIX defaults to 10.  The procedure `number->string'           |
     takes a number and a radix and returns as a string an external           |
     representation of the given number in the given radix such that          |

     (let ((number NUMBER)                                                    |
           (radix RADIX))                                                     |
       (eqv? number                                                           |
             (string->number (number->string number                           |
                                             radix)                           |
                             radix)))                                         |

     is true.  It is an error if no possible result makes this                |
     expression true.                                                         |

     If Z is inexact, the radix is 10, and the above expression can be        |
     satisfied by a result that contains a decimal point, then the            |
     result contains a decimal point and is expressed using the minimum       |
     number of digits (exclusive of exponent and trailing zeroes)             |
     needed to make the above expression true [howtoprint], [howtoread];      |
     otherwise the format of the result is unspecified.                       |

     The result returned by `number->string' never contains an explicit       |
     radix prefix.                                                            |

          _Note:_ The error case can occur only when Z is not a complex       |
          number or is a complex number with a non-rational real or           |
          imaginary part.                                                     |

          _Rationale:_ If Z is an inexact number represented using            |
          flonums, and the radix is 10, then the above expression is          |
          normally satisfied by a result containing a decimal point.          |
          The unspecified case allows for infinities, NaNs, and               |
          non-flonum representations.                                         |
                                                                              |

     Returns a number of the maximally precise representation expressed       |
     by the given STRING.  RADIX must be an exact integer, either 2, 8,       |
     10, or 16.  If supplied, RADIX is a default radix that may be            |
     overridden by an explicit radix prefix in STRING (e.g. "#o177").         |
     If RADIX is not supplied, then the default radix is 10.  If STRING       |
     is not a syntactically valid notation for a number, then                 |
     `string->number' returns #f.                                             |

     (string->number "100")                 ==>  100                          |
     (string->number "100" 16)              ==>  256                          |
     (string->number "1e2")                 ==>  100.0                        |
     (string->number "15##")                ==>  1500.0                       |

          _Note:_ The domain of `string->number' may be restricted by         |
          implementations in the following ways.  `String->number' is         |
          permitted to return #f whenever STRING contains an explicit         |
          radix prefix.  If all numbers supported by an implementation        |
          are real, then `string->number' is permitted to return #f           |
          whenever STRING uses the polar or rectangular notations for         |
          complex numbers.  If all numbers are integers, then                 |
          `string->number' may return #f whenever the fractional              |
          notation is used.  If all numbers are exact, then                   |
          `string->number' may return #f whenever an exponent marker or       |
          explicit exactness prefix is used, or if a # appears in place       |
          of a digit.  If all inexact numbers are integers, then              |
          `string->number' may return #f whenever a decimal point is          |
          used.                                                               |

This section describes operations on some of Scheme's non-numeric data        |
types: booleans, pairs, lists, symbols, characters, strings and vectors.      |

                                                                              |
Booleans                                                                      |
--------                                                                      |

The standard boolean objects for true and false are written as #t and         |
#f.  What really matters, though, are the objects that the Scheme             |
conditional expressions (`if', `cond', `and', `or', `do') treat as true       |
or false.  The phrase "a true value" (or sometimes just "true") means         |
any object treated as true by the conditional expressions, and the            |
phrase "a false value" (or "false") means any object treated as false         |
by the conditional expressions.                                               |

Of all the standard Scheme values, only #f counts as false in                 |
conditional expressions.  Except for #f, all standard Scheme values,          |
including #t, pairs, the empty list, symbols, numbers, strings,               |
vectors, and procedures, count as true.                                       |

     _Note:_ Programmers accustomed to other dialects of Lisp should be       |
     aware that Scheme distinguishes both #f and the empty list from          |
     the symbol `nil'.                                                        |

Boolean constants evaluate to themselves, so they do not need to be           |
quoted in programs.                                                           |
                                                                              |

     #f                                     ==>  #f                           |
     '#f                                    ==>  #f                           |

 - library procedure: not obj                                                 |
     `Not' returns #t if OBJ is false, and returns #f otherwise.              |

     (not #t)                               ==>  #f                           |
     (not 3)                                ==>  #f                           |
     (not (list 3))                         ==>  #f                           |
     (not #f)                               ==>  #t                           |
     (not '())                              ==>  #f                           |
     (not (list))                           ==>  #f                           |
     (not 'nil)                             ==>  #f                           |
                                                                              |

 - library procedure: boolean? obj                                            |
     `Boolean?' returns #t if OBJ is either #t or #f and returns #f           |
     otherwise.                                                               |

     (boolean? 0)                           ==>  #f                           |
     (boolean? '())                         ==>  #f                           |
                                                                              |

                                                                              |
Pairs and lists                                                               |
---------------                                                               |

A "pair" (sometimes called a "dotted pair") is a record structure with        |
two fields called the car and cdr fields (for historical reasons).            |
Pairs are created by the procedure `cons'.  The car and cdr fields are        |
accessed by the procedures `car' and `cdr'.  The car and cdr fields are       |
assigned by the procedures `set-car!' and `set-cdr!'.                         |

Pairs are used primarily to represent lists.  A list can be defined           |
recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose cdr is a list.           |
More precisely, the set of lists is defined as the smallest set X such        |
that                                                                          |

   * The empty list is in X.                                                  |

   * If LIST is in X, then any pair whose cdr field contains LIST is          |
     also in X.                                                               |
                                                                              |

The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are the           |
elements of the list.  For example, a two-element list is a pair whose        |
car is the first element and whose cdr is a pair whose car is the             |
second element and whose cdr is the empty list.  The length of a list         |
is the number of elements, which is the same as the number of pairs.          |

The empty list is a special object of its own type (it is not a pair);        |
it has no elements and its length is zero.                                    |

     _Note:_ The above definitions imply that all lists have finite           |
     length and are terminated by the empty list.                             |

The most general notation (external representation) for Scheme pairs is       |
the "dotted" notation `(C1 . C2)' where C1 is the value of the car            |
field and C2 is the value of the cdr field.  For example `(4 . 5)' is a       |
pair whose car is 4 and whose cdr is 5.  Note that `(4 . 5)' is the           |
external representation of a pair, not an expression that evaluates to        |
a pair.                                                                       |

A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the elements of the        |
list are simply enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces.  The         |
empty list is written () .  For example,                                      |
                                                                              |

     (a b c d e)                                                              |

and                                                                           |
                                                                              |

     (a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))                                         |

are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.                               |

A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an "improper          |
list".  Note that an improper list is not a list.  The list and dotted        |
notations can be combined to represent improper lists:                        |
                                                                              |

     (a b c . d)                                                              |

is equivalent to                                                              |
                                                                              |

     (a . (b . (c . d)))                                                      |

Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored in the cdr         |
field.  When the `set-cdr!' procedure is used, an object can be a list        |
one moment and not the next:                                                  |
                                                                              |

     (define x (list 'a 'b 'c))                                               |
     (define y x)                                                             |
     y                                      ==>  (a b c)                      |
     (list? y)                              ==>  #t                           |
     (set-cdr! x 4)                         ==>  _unspecified_                |
     x                                      ==>  (a . 4)                      |
     (eqv? x y)                             ==>  #t                           |
     y                                      ==>  (a . 4)                      |
     (list? y)                              ==>  #f                           |
     (set-cdr! x x)                         ==>  _unspecified_                |
     (list? x)                              ==>  #f                           |

Within literal expressions and representations of objects read by the         |
`read' procedure, the forms '<datum>, `<datum>, ,<datum>, and ,@<datum>       |
denote two-element lists whose first elements are the symbols `quote',        |
`quasiquote', `unquote', and `unquote-splicing', respectively.  The           |
second element in each case is <datum>.  This convention is supported         |
so that arbitrary Scheme programs may be represented as lists.   That         |
is, according to Scheme's grammar, every <expression> is also a <datum>       |
(see section *note External representation::).  Among other things,           |
this permits the use of the `read' procedure to parse Scheme programs.        |
See section *Note External representations::.                                 |

          _Rationale:_ Although they are ordinarily used as predicates,       |
          `memq', `memv', `member', `assq', `assv', and `assoc' do not        |
          have question marks in their names because they return useful       |
          values rather than just #t or #f.                                   |
                                                                              |

-------                                                                       |

Symbols are objects whose usefulness rests on the fact that two symbols       |
are identical (in the sense of `eqv?') if and only if their names are         |
spelled the same way.  This is exactly the property needed to represent       |
identifiers in programs, and so most implementations of Scheme use them       |
internally for that purpose.  Symbols are useful for many other               |
applications; for instance, they may be used the way enumerated values        |
are used in Pascal.                                                           |
                                                                              |
The rules for writing a symbol are exactly the same as the rules for          |
writing an identifier; see sections *Note Identifiers:: and *Note             |
Lexical structure::.                                                          |
                                                                              |
It is guaranteed that any symbol that has been returned as part of a          |
literal expression, or read using the `read' procedure, and                   |
subsequently written out using the `write' procedure, will read back in       |
as the identical symbol (in the sense of `eqv?').  The `string->symbol'       |
procedure, however, can create symbols for which this write/read              |
invariance may not hold because their names contain special characters        |
or letters in the non-standard case.                                          |
                                                                              |
     _Note:_ Some implementations of Scheme have a feature known as           |
     "slashification" in order to guarantee write/read invariance for         |
     all symbols, but historically the most important use of this             |
     feature has been to compensate for the lack of a string data type.       |
                                                                              |
     Some implementations also have "uninterned symbols", which defeat        |
     write/read invariance even in implementations with slashification,       |
     and also generate exceptions to the rule that two symbols are the        |
     same if and only if their names are spelled the same.                    |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: symbol->string symbol                                           |
     Returns the name of SYMBOL as a string.  If the symbol was part of       |
     an object returned as the value of a literal expression (section         |
     *note Literal expressions::) or by a call to the `read' procedure,       |
     and its name contains alphabetic characters, then the string             |
     returned will contain characters in the implementation's preferred       |
     standard case--some implementations will prefer upper case, others       |
     lower case.  If the symbol was returned by `string->symbol', the         |
     case of characters in the string returned will be the same as the        |
     case in the string that was passed to `string->symbol'.  It is an        |
     error to apply mutation procedures like `string-set!' to strings         |
     returned by this procedure.                                              |

     create symbols with names containing special characters or letters       |
     in the non-standard case, but it is usually a bad idea to create         |
     such symbols because in some implementations of Scheme they cannot       |
     be read as themselves.  See `symbol->string'.                            |

Characters
----------                                                                    |

Characters are objects that represent printed characters such as
letters and digits.  Characters are written using the notation
#\<character> or #\<character name>.  For example:

                                   
    #\a
          ; lower case letter

    #\A
          ; upper case letter

    #\(
          ; left parenthesis

    #\
          ; the space character

    #\space
          ; the preferred way to write a space

    #\newline
          ; the newline character



Case is significant in #\<character>, but not in #\<character name>.

If <character> in #\<character> is alphabetic, then the character
following <character> must be a delimiter character such as a space or
parenthesis.  This rule resolves the ambiguous case where, for example,
the sequence of characters "#\ space" could be taken to be either a
representation of the space character or a representation of the
character "#\ s" followed by a representation of the symbol "pace."

Characters written in the #\ notation are self-evaluating.  That is,
they do not have to be quoted in programs.

Some of the procedures that operate on characters ignore the difference
between upper case and lower case.  The procedures that ignore case
have "-ci" (for "case insensitive") embedded in their names.

 - procedure: char? obj                                                       |
     Returns #t if OBJ is a character, otherwise returns #f.


 - procedure: char=? char1 char2                                              |
 - procedure: char<? char1 char2                                              |
 - procedure: char>? char1 char2                                              |
 - procedure: char<=? char1 char2                                             |
 - procedure: char>=? char1 char2                                             |
     These procedures impose a total ordering on the set of characters.
     It is guaranteed that under this ordering:

        * The upper case characters are in order.  For example,
          `(char<? #\A #\B)' returns #t.

        * The lower case characters are in order.  For example,
          `(char<? #\a #\b)' returns #t.

        * The digits are in order.  For example, `(char<? #\0 #\9)'
          returns #t.

        * Either all the digits precede all the upper case letters, or
          vice versa.

        * Either all the digits precede all the lower case letters, or
          vice versa.


     Some implementations may generalize these procedures to take more
     than two arguments, as with the corresponding numerical predicates.


 - library procedure: char-ci=? char1 char2                                   |
 - library procedure: char-ci<? char1 char2                                   |
 - library procedure: char-ci>? char1 char2                                   |
 - library procedure: char-ci<=? char1 char2                                  |
 - library procedure: char-ci>=? char1 char2                                  |
     These procedures are similar to `char=?' et cetera, but they treat
     upper case and lower case letters as the same.  For example,
     `(char-ci=? #\A #\a)' returns #t.  Some implementations may
     generalize these procedures to take more than two arguments, as
     with the corresponding numerical predicates.


 - library procedure: char-alphabetic? char                                   |
 - library procedure: char-numeric? char                                      |
 - library procedure: char-whitespace? char                                   |
 - library procedure: char-upper-case? letter                                 |
 - library procedure: char-lower-case? letter                                 |
     These procedures return #t if their arguments are alphabetic,
     numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case characters,
     respectively, otherwise they return #f.  The following remarks,
     which are specific to the ASCII character set, are intended only
     as a guide:  The alphabetic characters are the 52 upper and lower
     case letters.  The numeric characters are the ten decimal digits.
     The whitespace characters are space, tab, line feed, form feed,
     and carriage return.

 - procedure: char->integer char                                              |
 - procedure: integer->char N                                                 |
     Given a character, `char->integer' returns an exact integer
     representation of the character.  Given an exact integer that is
     the image of a character under `char->integer', `integer->char'
     returns that character.  These procedures implement                      |
     order-preserving isomorphisms between the set of characters under        |
     the `char<=?' ordering and some subset of the integers under the         |
     `<=' ordering.  That is, if                                              |

     (char<=? A B) => #t  and  (<= X Y) => #t

     and X and Y are in the domain of `integer->char', then

     (<= (char->integer A)
         (char->integer B))                 ==>  #t

 - library procedure: char-upcase char                                        |
 - library procedure: char-downcase char                                      |
     These procedures return a character CHAR2 such that `(char-ci=?
     CHAR CHAR2)'.  In addition, if CHAR is alphabetic, then the result
     of `char-upcase' is upper case and the result of `char-downcase'
     is lower case.

Strings
-------                                                                       |

Strings are sequences of characters.  Strings are written as sequences
of characters enclosed within doublequotes (`"').  A doublequote can be
written inside a string only by escaping it with a backslash (\), as in


     "The word \"recursion\" has many meanings."

A backslash can be written inside a string only by escaping it with
another backslash.  Scheme does not specify the effect of a backslash
within a string that is not followed by a doublequote or backslash.

A string constant may continue from one line to the next, but the exact
contents of such a string are unspecified.

The _length_ of a string is the number of characters that it contains.
This number is an exact, non-negative integer that is fixed when the          |
string is created.  The "valid indexes" of a string are the exact             |
non-negative integers less than the length of the string.  The first          |
character of a string has index 0, the second has index 1, and so on.         |

In phrases such as "the characters of STRING beginning with index START
and ending with index END," it is understood that the index START is
inclusive and the index END is exclusive.  Thus if START and END are
the same index, a null substring is referred to, and if START is zero
and END is the length of STRING, then the entire string is referred to.

Some of the procedures that operate on strings ignore the difference
between upper and lower case.  The versions that ignore case have
"`-ci'" (for "case insensitive") embedded in their names.

 - procedure: string? obj                                                     |
     Returns #t if OBJ is a string, otherwise returns #f.

 - procedure: make-string K                                                   |
 - procedure: make-string K char                                              |
     `Make-string' returns a newly allocated string of length K.  If
     CHAR is given, then all elements of the string are initialized to
     CHAR, otherwise the contents of the STRING are unspecified.


 - library procedure: string char ...                                         |
     Returns a newly allocated string composed of the arguments.


 - procedure: string-length string                                            |
     Returns the number of characters in the given STRING.

 - procedure: string-ref string K                                             |
     K must be a valid index of STRING.  `String-ref' returns character
     K of STRING using zero-origin indexing.

 - procedure: string-set! string k char                                       |
     K must be a valid index of STRING .  `String-set!' stores CHAR in
     element K of STRING and returns an unspecified value.

     (define (f) (make-string 3 #\*))
     (define (g) "***")
     (string-set! (f) 0 #\?)                ==>  _unspecified_
     (string-set! (g) 0 #\?)                ==>  _error_
     (string-set! (symbol->string 'immutable)
                  0
                  #\?)                      ==>  _error_


 - library procedure: string=? string1 string2                                |
 - library procedure: string-ci=? string1 string2                             |
     Returns #t if the two strings are the same length and contain the
     same characters in the same positions, otherwise returns #f.
     `String-ci=?' treats upper and lower case letters as though they
     were the same character, but `string=?' treats upper and lower
     case as distinct characters.


 - library procedure: string<? string1 string2                                |
 - library procedure: string>? string1 string2                                |
 - library procedure: string<=? string1 string2                               |
 - library procedure: string>=? string1 string2                               |
 - library procedure: string-ci<? string1 string2                             |
 - library procedure: string-ci>? string1 string2                             |
 - library procedure: string-ci<=? string1 string2                            |
 - library procedure: string-ci>=? string1 string2                            |
     These procedures are the lexicographic extensions to strings of the
     corresponding orderings on characters.  For example, `string<?' is
     the lexicographic ordering on strings induced by the ordering
     `char<?' on characters.  If two strings differ in length but are
     the same up to the length of the shorter string, the shorter string
     is considered to be lexicographically less than the longer string.

     Implementations may generalize these and the `string=?' and
     `string-ci=?' procedures to take more than two arguments, as with
     the corresponding numerical predicates.


 - library procedure: substring string start end                              |
     STRING must be a string, and START and END must be exact integers
     satisfying

                0 <= START <= END <= (string-length STRING).

     `Substring' returns a newly allocated string formed from the
     characters of STRING beginning with index START (inclusive) and
     ending with index END (exclusive).

 - library procedure: string-append STRING ...                                |
     Returns a newly allocated string whose characters form the
     concatenation of the given strings.


 - library procedure: string->list string                                     |
 - library procedure: list->string list                                       |
     `String->list' returns a newly allocated list of the characters
     that make up the given string.  `List->string' returns a newly
     allocated string formed from the characters in the list LIST,            |
     which must be a list of characters. `String->list' and                   |
     `list->string' are inverses so far as `equal?' is concerned.             |


 - library procedure: string-copy string                                      |
     Returns a newly allocated copy of the given STRING.


 - library procedure: string-fill! string char                                |
     Stores CHAR in every element of the given STRING and returns an
     unspecified value.

                                                                              |
Vectors
-------                                                                       |

Vectors are heterogenous structures whose elements are indexed by
integers.  A vector typically occupies less space than a list of the
same length, and the average time required to access a randomly chosen
element is typically less for the vector than for the list.

The _length_ of a vector is the number of elements that it contains.
This number is a non-negative integer that is fixed when the vector is
created.  The _valid indexes_ of a vector are the exact non-negative
integers less than the length of the vector.  The first element in a
vector is indexed by zero, and the last element is indexed by one less
than the length of the vector.

Vectors are written using the notation #(OBJ ...).  For example, a
vector of length 3 containing the number zero in element 0, the list
`(2 2 2 2)' in element 1, and the string `"Anna"' in element 2 can be
written as following:


     #(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")

Note that this is the external representation of a vector, not an
expression evaluating to a vector.  Like list constants, vector
constants must be quoted:


     '#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
               ==>  #(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")

 - procedure: vector? obj                                                     |
     Returns #t if OBJ is a vector, otherwise returns #f.

 - procedure: make-vector k                                                   |
 - procedure: make-vector k fill
     Returns a newly allocated vector of K elements.  If a second
     argument is given, then each element is initialized to FILL.
     Otherwise the initial contents of each element is unspecified.


 - library procedure: vector obj ...                                          |
     Returns a newly allocated vector whose elements contain the given
     arguments.  Analogous to `list'.

     (vector 'a 'b 'c)                      ==>  #(a b c)


 - procedure: vector-length vector                                            |
     Returns the number of elements in VECTOR as an exact integer.            |

 - procedure: vector-ref vector k                                             |
     K must be a valid index of VECTOR.  `Vector-ref' returns the
     contents of element K of VECTOR.

     (vector-ref '#(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21)
                 5)
               ==>  8
     (vector-ref '#(1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21)
                 (let ((i (round (* 2 (acos -1)))))                           |
                   (if (inexact? i)                                           |
                       (inexact->exact i)                                     |
                       i)))                                                   |
               ==> 13


 - procedure: vector-set! vector k obj                                        |
     K must be a valid index of VECTOR.  `Vector-set!' stores OBJ in
     element K of VECTOR.  The value returned by `vector-set!' is
     unspecified.

     (let ((vec (vector 0 '(2 2 2 2) "Anna")))
       (vector-set! vec 1 '("Sue" "Sue"))
       vec)
               ==>  #(0 ("Sue" "Sue") "Anna")
     
     (vector-set! '#(0 1 2) 1 "doe")
               ==>  _error_  ; constant vector


 - library procedure: vector->list vector                                     |
 - library procedure: list->vector list                                       |
     `Vector->list' returns a newly allocated list of the objects
     contained in the elements of VECTOR.  `List->vector' returns a
     newly created vector initialized to the elements of the list LIST.

     (vector->list '#(dah dah didah))
               ==>  (dah dah didah)
     (list->vector '(dididit dah))
               ==>  #(dididit dah)


 - library procedure: vector-fill! vector fill                                |
     Stores FILL in every element of VECTOR.  The value returned by
     `vector-fill!' is unspecified.

Control features
================

This chapter describes various primitive procedures which control the
flow of program execution in special ways.  The `procedure?' predicate
is also described here.

 - procedure: procedure? obj                                                  |
     Returns #t if OBJ is a procedure, otherwise returns #f.

     (procedure? car)                       ==>  #t
     (procedure? 'car)                      ==>  #f
     (procedure? (lambda (x) (* x x)))
                                            ==>  #t
     (procedure? '(lambda (x) (* x x)))
                                            ==>  #f
     (call-with-current-continuation procedure?)
                                            ==>  #t

                                                                              |
 - procedure: apply proc arg1 ... args
     PROC must be a procedure and ARGS must be a list.  Calls PROC with       |
     the elements of the list `(append (list ARG1 ...) ARGS)' as the          |
     actual arguments.                                                        |

     (apply + (list 3 4))                   ==>  7
     
     (define compose
       (lambda (f g)
         (lambda args
           (f (apply g args)))))
     
     ((compose sqrt *) 12 75)               ==>  30


 - library procedure: map proc list1 list2 ...                                |
     The LISTs must be lists, and PROC must be a procedure taking as
     many arguments as there are lists and returning a single value.          |
     If more than one LIST is given, then they must all be the same           |
     length.  `Map' applies PROC element-wise to the elements of the          |
     LISTs and returns a list of the results, in order.  The dynamic          |
     order in which PROC is applied to the elements of the LISTs is           |
     unspecified.                                                             |

     (map cadr '((a b) (d e) (g h)))
               ==>  (b e h)
     
     (map (lambda (n) (expt n n))
          '(1 2 3 4 5))
               ==>  (1 4 27 256 3125)
     
     (map + '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))              ==>  (5 7 9)
     
     (let ((count 0))
       (map (lambda (ignored)
              (set! count (+ count 1))
              count)
            '(a b)))                        ==>  (1 2) OR (2 1)               |


 - library procedure: for-each proc list1 list2 ...                           |
     The arguments to `for-each' are like the arguments to `map', but
     `for-each' calls PROC for its side effects rather than for its
     values.  Unlike `map', `for-each' is guaranteed to call PROC on
     the elements of the LISTs in order from the first element(s) to the      |
     last, and the value returned by `for-each' is unspecified.

     (let ((v (make-vector 5)))
       (for-each (lambda (i)
                   (vector-set! v i (* i i)))
                 '(0 1 2 3 4))
       v)                                   ==>  #(0 1 4 9 16)


 - library procedure: force promise                                           |
     Forces the value of PROMISE (see `delay', section *note Delayed
     evaluation::).  If no value has been computed for the promise,
     then a value is computed and returned.  The value of the promise
     is cached (or "memoized") so that if it is forced a second time,
     the previously computed value is returned.

     (force (delay (+ 1 2)))                ==>  3
     (let ((p (delay (+ 1 2))))
       (list (force p) (force p)))
                                            ==>  (3 3)
     
     (define a-stream
       (letrec ((next
                 (lambda (n)
                   (cons n (delay (next (+ n 1)))))))
         (next 0)))
     (define head car)
     (define tail
       (lambda (stream) (force (cdr stream))))
     
     (head (tail (tail a-stream)))
                                            ==>  2

     `Force' and `delay' are mainly intended for programs written in
     functional style.  The following examples should not be considered
     to illustrate good programming style, but they illustrate the
     property that only one value is computed for a promise, no matter
     how many times it is forced.

     (define count 0)
     (define p
       (delay (begin (set! count (+ count 1))
                     (if (> count x)
                         count
                         (force p)))))
     (define x 5)
     p                                      ==>  a promise
     (force p)                              ==>  6
     p                                      ==>  a promise, still
     (begin (set! x 10)
            (force p))                      ==>  6

     Here is a possible implementation of `delay' and `force'.
     Promises are implemented here as procedures of no arguments, and
     `force' simply calls its argument:

     (define force
       (lambda (object)
         (object)))

     We define the expression

     (delay <expression>)

     to have the same meaning as the procedure call

     (make-promise (lambda () <expression>))                                  |
                                                                              |
     as follows                                                               |
                                                                              |
     (define-syntax delay                                                     |

          (make-promise (lambda () expression))))),                           |

     where `make-promise' is defined as follows:

     (define make-promise
       (lambda (proc)
         (let ((result-ready? #f)
               (result #f))
           (lambda ()
             (if result-ready?
                 result
                 (let ((x (proc)))
                   (if result-ready?
                       result
                       (begin (set! result-ready? #t)
                              (set! result x)
                              result))))))))

          _Rationale:_ A promise may refer to its own value, as in the
          last example above.  Forcing such a promise may cause the
          promise to be forced a second time before the value of the
          first force has been computed.  This complicates the
          definition of `make-promise'.

     Various extensions to this semantics of `delay' and `force' are
     supported in some implementations:

        * Calling `force' on an object that is not a promise may simply
          return the object.

        * It may be the case that there is no means by which a promise
          can be operationally distinguished from its forced value.
          That is, expressions like the following may evaluate to
          either #t or to #f, depending on the implementation:

          (eqv? (delay 1) 1)                ==>  _unspecified_
          (pair? (delay (cons 1 2)))        ==>  _unspecified_

        * Some implementations may implement "implicit forcing," where
          the value of a promise is forced by primitive procedures like
          `cdr' and `+':

          (+ (delay (* 3 7)) 13)            ==>  34



 - procedure: call-with-current-continuation proc                             |
     PROC must be a procedure of one argument. The procedure
     `call-with-current-continuation' packages up the current
     continuation (see the rationale below) as an "escape procedure"
     and passes it as an argument to PROC.  The escape procedure is a
     Scheme procedure that, if it is later called, will abandon               |
     whatever continuation is in effect at that later time and will           |
     instead use the continuation that was in effect when the escape          |
     procedure was created.  Calling the escape procedure may cause the       |
     invocation of BEFORE and AFTER thunks installed using                    |
     `dynamic-wind'.                                                          |
                                                                              |
     The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the         |
     continuation to the original call to                                     |
     call-with-current-continuation.  Except for continuations created        |
     by the `call-with-values' procedure, all continuations take              |
     exactly one value.  The effect of passing no value or more than          |
     one value to continuations that were not created by                      |
     call-with-values is unspecified.                                         |

     The escape procedure that is passed to PROC has unlimited extent
     just like any other procedure in Scheme.  It may be stored in
     variables or data structures and may be called as many times as
     desired.

     The following examples show only the most common ways in which           |
     `call-with-current-continuation' is used.  If all real uses were as      |
     simple as these examples, there would be no need for a procedure
     with the power of `call-with-current-continuation'.

          _Rationale:_                                                        |

          A common use of `call-with-current-continuation' is for             |
          structured, non-local exits from loops or procedure bodies,         |
          but in fact `call-with-current-continuation' is extremely           |
          useful for implementing a wide variety of advanced control          |
          structures.                                                         |

          Whenever a Scheme expression is evaluated there is a                |
          "continuation" wanting the result of the expression.  The           |
          continuation represents an entire (default) future for the          |
          computation.  If the expression is evaluated at top level,          |
          for example, then the continuation might take the result,           |
          print it on the screen, prompt for the next input, evaluate         |
          it, and so on forever.  Most of the time the continuation           |
          includes actions specified by user code, as in a continuation       |
          that will take the result, multiply it by the value stored in       |
          a local variable, add seven, and give the answer to the top         |
          level continuation to be printed.  Normally these ubiquitous        |
          continuations are hidden behind the scenes and programmers do       |
          not think much about them.  On rare occasions, however, a           |
          programmer may need to deal with continuations explicitly.          |
          `Call-with-current-continuation' allows Scheme programmers to       |
          do that by creating a procedure that acts just like the             |
          current continuation.                                               |

          Most programming languages incorporate one or more                  |
          special-purpose escape constructs with names like exit,             |
          `return', or even goto.  In 1965, however, Peter Landin             |
          [Landin65] invented a general purpose escape operator called        |
          the J-operator.  John Reynolds [Reynolds72] described a             |
          simpler but equally powerful construct in 1972.  The `catch'        |
          special form described by Sussman and Steele in the 1975            |
          report on Scheme is exactly the same as Reynolds's construct,       |
          though its name came from a less general construct in               |
          MacLisp.  Several Scheme implementors noticed that the full         |
          power of the `catch' construct could be provided by a               |
          procedure instead of by a special syntactic construct, and          |
          the name `call-with-current-continuation' was coined in 1982.       |
          This name is descriptive, but opinions differ on the merits         |
          of such a long name, and some people use the name `call/cc'         |
          instead.                                                            |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: values obj ...                                                  |
     Delivers all of its arguments to its continuation.  Except for           |
     continuations created by the `call-with-values' procedure, all           |
     continuations take exactly one value.  Values might be defined as        |
     follows:                                                                 |

 - procedure: call-with-values producer consumer                              |
     Calls its PRODUCER argument with no values and a continuation            |
     that, when passed some values, calls the CONSUMER procedure with         |
     those values as arguments.  The continuation for the call to             |
     CONSUMER is the continuation of the call to call-with-values.            |
                                                                              |

                                                                              |
 - procedure: dynamic-wind before thunk after                                 |
     Calls THUNK without arguments, returning the result(s) of this           |
     call.  BEFORE and AFTER are called, also without arguments, as           |
     required by the following rules (note that in the absence of calls       |
     to continuations captured using `call-with-current-continuation'         |
     the three arguments are called once each, in order).  BEFORE is          |
     called whenever execution enters the dynamic extent of the call to       |
     THUNK and AFTER is called whenever it exits that dynamic extent.         |
     The dynamic extent of a procedure call is the period between when        |
     the call is initiated and when it returns.  In Scheme, because of        |
     `call-with-current-continuation', the dynamic extent of a call may       |
     not be a single, connected time period.  It is defined as follows:       |
                                                                              |
        * The dynamic extent is entered when execution of the body of         |
          the called procedure begins.                                        |
                                                                              |
        * The dynamic extent is also entered when execution is not            |
          within the dynamic extent and a continuation is invoked that        |
          was captured (using `call-with-current-continuation') during        |
          the dynamic extent.                                                 |
                                                                              |
        * It is exited when the called procedure returns.                     |
                                                                              |
        * It is also exited when execution is within the dynamic extent       |
          and a continuation is invoked that was captured while not           |
          within the dynamic extent.                                          |
                                                                              |
                                                                              |
     If a second call to `dynamic-wind' occurs within the dynamic             |
     extent of the call to THUNK and then a continuation is invoked in        |
     such a way that the AFTERs from these two invocations of                 |
     `dynamic-wind' are both to be called, then the AFTER associated          |
     with the second (inner) call to `dynamic-wind' is called first.          |
                                                                              |
     If a second call to `dynamic-wind' occurs within the dynamic             |

     `dynamic-wind' are both to be called, then the BEFORE associated         |
     with the first (outer) call to `dynamic-wind' is called first.           |
                                                                              |
     If invoking a continuation requires calling the BEFORE from one          |
     call to `dynamic-wind' and the AFTER from another, then the AFTER        |
     is called first.                                                         |

     Evaluates EXPRESSION in the specified environment and returns its        |
     value.  EXPRESSION must be a valid Scheme expression represented         |
     as data, and ENVIRONMENT-SPECIFIER must be a value returned by one       |
     of the three procedures described below.  Implementations may            |
     extend `eval' to allow non-expression programs (definitions) as          |
     the first argument and to allow other values as environments, with       |
     the restriction that `eval' is not allowed to create new bindings        |
     in the environments associated with `null-environment' or                |

     VERSION must be the exact integer `5', corresponding to this             |
     revision of the Scheme report (the Revised^5 Report on Scheme).          |
     `Scheme-report-environment' returns a specifier for an environment       |
     that is empty except for all bindings defined in this report that        |
     are either required or both optional and supported by the                |
     implementation. `Null-environment' returns a specifier for an            |
     environment that is empty except for the (syntactic) bindings for        |
     all syntactic keywords defined in this report that are either            |
     required or both optional and supported by the implementation.           |
                                                                              |
     Other values of VERSION can be used to specify environments              |
     matching past revisions of this report, but their support is not         |
     required.  An implementation will signal an error if VERSION is          |
     neither `5' nor another value supported by the implementation.           |
                                                                              |
     The effect of assigning (through the use of `eval') a variable           |
     bound in a `scheme-report-environment' (for example `car') is            |
     unspecified.  Thus the environments specified by                         |
     `scheme-report-environment' may be immutable.                            |
                                                                              |

 - optional procedure: interaction-environment                                |
     This procedure returns a specifier for the environment that              |
     contains implementation-defined bindings, typically a superset of        |
     those listed in the report.  The intent is that this procedure           |
     will return the environment in which the implementation would            |
     evaluate expressions dynamically typed by the user.                      |

Ports represent input and output devices.  To Scheme, an input port is a      |
Scheme object that can deliver characters upon command, while an output       |
port is a Scheme object that can accept characters.                           |

 - library procedure: call-with-input-file string proc                        |
 - library procedure: call-with-output-file string proc                       |
     STRING should be a string naming a file, and PROC should be a            |
     procedure that accepts one argument.  For `call-with-input-file',        |
     the file should already exist; for `call-with-output-file', the          |
     effect is unspecified if the file already exists. These procedures       |
     call PROC with one argument: the port obtained by opening the            |
     named file for input or output.  If the file cannot be opened, an        |
     error is signalled.  If PROC returns, then the port is closed            |
     automatically and the value(s) yielded by the PROC is(are)               |
     returned.  If PROC does not return, then the port will not be            |
     closed automatically unless it is possible to prove that the port        |
     will never again be used for a read or write operation.                  |
                                                                              |
          _Rationale:_ Because Scheme's escape procedures have                |
          unlimited extent, it  is possible to escape from the current        |
          continuation but later to escape back in.  If implementations       |
          were permitted to close the port on any escape from the             |
          current continuation, then it would be impossible to write          |
          portable code using both `call-with-current-continuation' and       |
          `call-with-input-file' or `call-with-output-file'.                  |
                                                                              |


 - procedure: input-port? obj                                                 |
 - procedure: output-port? obj                                                |
     Returns #t if OBJ is an input port or output port respectively,          |
     otherwise returns #f.                                                    |


 - procedure: current-input-port                                              |
 - procedure: current-output-port                                             |
     Returns the current default input or output port.                        |
                                                                              |

 - optional procedure: with-input-from-file string thunk                      |
 - optional procedure: with-output-to-file string thunk                       |
     STRING should be a string naming a file, and PROC should be a            |
     procedure of no arguments.  For `with-input-from-file', the file         |
     should already exist; for `with-output-to-file', the effect is           |
     unspecified if the file already exists.  The file is opened for          |
     input or output, an input or output port connected to it is made         |
     the default value returned by `current-input-port' or                    |
     `current-output-port' (and is used by (read), (write OBJ), and so        |
     forth), and the THUNK is called with no arguments.  When the THUNK       |
     returns, the port is closed and the previous default is restored.        |
     `With-input-from-file' and `with-output-to-file' return(s) the           |
     value(s) yielded by THUNK.  If an escape procedure is used to            |
     escape from the continuation of these procedures, their behavior         |
     is implementation dependent.                                             |


 - procedure: open-input-file filename                                        |
     Takes a string naming an existing file and returns an input port         |
     capable of delivering characters from the file.  If the file             |
     cannot be opened, an error is signalled.                                 |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: open-output-file filename                                       |
     Takes a string naming an output file to be created and returns an        |
     output port capable of writing characters to a new file by that          |
     name.  If the file cannot be opened, an error is signalled.  If a        |
     file with the given name already exists, the effect is unspecified.      |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: close-input-port port                                           |
 - procedure: close-output-port port                                          |
     Closes the file associated with PORT, rendering the PORT incapable       |
     of delivering or accepting characters.                                   |
                                                                              |
     These routines have no effect if the file has already been closed.       |
     The value returned is unspecified.                                       |

     <datum> (see sections *note External representation:: and *note          |
     Pairs and lists::).  `Read' returns the next object parsable from        |
     the given input PORT, updating PORT to point to the first                |
     character past the end of the external representation of the             |
     object.                                                                  |
                                                                              |
     If an end of file is encountered in the input before any                 |
     characters are found that can begin an object, then an end of file       |
     object is returned.   The port remains open, and further attempts        |
     to read will also return an end of file object.  If an end of file       |
     is encountered after the beginning of an object's external               |
     representation, but the external representation is incomplete and        |
     therefore not parsable, an error is signalled.                           |
                                                                              |
     The PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the       |
     value returned by `current-input-port'.  It is an error to read          |
     from a closed port.                                                      |
                                                                              |
 - procedure: read-char                                                       |
 - procedure: read-char port                                                  |
     Returns the next character available from the input PORT, updating       |
     the PORT to point to the following character.  If no more                |
     characters are available, an end of file object is returned.  PORT       |
     may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the value returned by       |
     `current-input-port'.                                                    |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: peek-char                                                       |
 - procedure: peek-char port                                                  |
     Returns the next character available from the input PORT,                |
     _without_ updating the PORT to point to the following character.         |
     If no more characters are available, an end of file object is            |
     returned.  PORT may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the         |
     value returned by `current-input-port'.                                  |

          _Note:_ The value returned by a call to `peek-char' is the          |
          same as the value that would have been returned by a call to        |
          `read-char' with the same PORT.  The only difference is that        |
          the very next call to `read-char' or `peek-char' on that PORT       |
          will return the value returned by the preceding call to             |
          `peek-char'.  In particular, a call to `peek-char' on an            |
          interactive port will hang waiting for input whenever a call        |
          to `read-char' would have hung.                                     |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: eof-object? obj                                                 |
     Returns #t if OBJ is an end of file object, otherwise returns #f.        |
     The precise set of end of file objects will vary among                   |
     implementations, but in any case no end of file object will ever         |
     be an object that can be read in using `read'.                           |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: char-ready?                                                     |
 - procedure: char-ready? port                                                |
     Returns #t if a character is ready on the input PORT and returns         |
     #f otherwise.  If `char-ready' returns #t then the next                  |
     `read-char' operation on the given PORT is guaranteed not to hang.       |
     If the PORT is at end of file then `char-ready?' returns #t.             |
     PORT may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the value              |
     returned by `current-input-port'.                                        |

          _Rationale:_ `Char-ready?' exists to make it possible for a         |
          program to accept characters from interactive ports without         |
          getting stuck waiting for input.  Any input editors                 |
          associated with such ports must ensure that characters whose        |
          existence has been asserted by `char-ready?' cannot be rubbed       |
          out.  If `char-ready?' were to return #f at end of file, a          |
          port at end of file would be indistinguishable from an              |
          interactive port that has no ready characters.                      |
                                                                              |

 - library procedure: write obj port                                          |
     Writes a written representation of OBJ to the given PORT.  Strings       |
     that appear in the written representation are enclosed in                |
     doublequotes, and within those strings backslash and doublequote         |
     characters are escaped by backslashes.  Character objects are            |
     written using the `#\' notation.  `Write' returns an unspecified         |
     value.  The PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it               |
     defaults to the value returned by `current-output-port'.                 |


 - library procedure: display obj                                             |
 - library procedure: display obj port                                        |
     Writes a representation of OBJ to the given PORT.  Strings that          |
     appear in the written representation are not enclosed in                 |
     doublequotes, and no characters are escaped within those strings.        |
     Character objects appear in the representation as if written by          |
     `write-char' instead of by `write'.  `Display' returns an                |
     unspecified value.  The PORT argument may be omitted, in which           |
     case it defaults to the value returned by `current-output-port'.         |

          _Rationale:_ `Write' is intended for producing                      |
          machine-readable output and `display' is for producing              |
          human-readable output.  Implementations that allow                  |
          "slashification" within symbols will probably want `write'          |
          but not `display' to slashify funny characters in symbols.          |
                                                                              |

 - library procedure: newline port                                            |
     Writes an end of line to PORT.  Exactly how this is done differs         |
     from one operating system to another.  Returns an unspecified            |
     value.  The PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it               |
     defaults to the value returned by `current-output-port'.                 |
                                                                              |

 - procedure: write-char char port                                            |
     Writes the character CHAR (not an external representation of the         |
     character) to the given PORT and returns an unspecified value.  The      |
     PORT argument may be omitted, in which case it defaults to the           |
     value returned by `current-output-port'.                                 |

----------------                                                              |

Questions of system interface generally fall outside of the domain of         |
this report.  However, the following operations are important enough to       |
deserve description here.                                                     |

 - optional procedure: load filename                                          |
     FILENAME should be a string naming an existing file containing           |
     Scheme source code.  The `load' procedure reads expressions and          |
     definitions from the file and evaluates them sequentially.  It is        |
     unspecified whether the results of the expressions are printed.          |
     The `load' procedure does not affect the values returned by              |
     `current-input-port' and `current-output-port'.  `Load' returns an       |
     unspecified value.                                                       |

          _Rationale:_ For portability, `load' must operate on source         |
          files.  Its operation on other kinds of files necessarily           |
          varies among implementations.                                       |
                                                                              |

 - optional procedure: transcript-on filename                                 |
 - optional procedure: transcript-off                                         |
     FILENAME must be a string naming an output file to be created. The       |
     effect of `transcript-on' is to open the named file for output,          |
     and to cause a transcript of subsequent interaction between the          |
     user and the Scheme system to be written to the file.  The               |
     transcript is ended by a call to `transcript-off', which closes the      |
     transcript file.  Only one transcript may be in progress at any          |
     time, though some implementations may relax this restriction.  The       |
     values returned by these procedures are unspecified.                     |

This section provides a formal syntax for Scheme written in an extended       |
BNF.                                                                          |

All spaces in the grammar are for legibility.  Case is insignificant;         |
for example, `#x1A' and `#X1a' are equivalent.  <empty> stands for the        |
empty string.                                                                 |
                                                                              |
The following extensions to BNF are used to make the description more         |
concise:  <thing>* means zero or more occurrences of <thing>; and             |
<thing>+ means at least one <thing>.                                          |

This section describes how individual tokens (identifiers, numbers,           |
etc.) are formed from sequences of characters.  The following sections        |
describe how expressions and programs are formed from sequences of            |
tokens.                                                                       |

<Intertoken space> may occur on either side of any token, but not             |
within a token.                                                               |

Tokens which require implicit termination (identifiers, numbers,              |
characters, and dot) may be terminated by any <delimiter>, but not            |
necessarily by anything else.                                                 |

The following five characters are reserved for future extensions to the       |
language: [ ] { } |                                                           |

The following rules for <num R>, <complex R>, <real R>, <ureal R>,            |
<uinteger R>, and <prefix R> should be replicated for R = 2, 8, 10, and       |
16.  There are no rules for <decimal 2>, <decimal 8>, and <decimal 16>,       |
which means that numbers containing decimal points or exponents must be       |
in decimal radix.                                                             |

The following grammar for quasiquote expressions is not context-free.         |
It is presented as a recipe for generating an infinite number of              |
production rules.  Imagine a copy of the following rules for D = 1,           |
2,3, ....  D keeps track of the nesting depth.                                |

<qq template 0> --> <expression>                                              |
<quasiquotation D> --> `<qq template D>                                       |
       | (quasiquote <qq template D>)                                         |

       | <list qq template D>                                                 |
       | <vector qq template D>                                               |
       | <unquotation D>                                                      |

       | <quasiquotation D+1>                                                 |
<vector qq template D> --> #(<qq template or splice D>*)                      |
<unquotation D> --> ,<qq template D-1>                                        |
       | (unquote <qq template D-1>)                                          |
<qq template or splice D> --> <qq template D>                                 |
       | <splicing unquotation D>                                             |
<splicing unquotation D> --> ,@<qq template D-1>                              |
       | (unquote-splicing <qq template D-1>)                                 |

In <quasiquotation>s, a <list qq template D> can sometimes be confused        |
with either an <unquotation D> or a <splicing unquotation D>.  The            |
interpretation as an <unquotation> or <splicing unquotation D> takes          |
precedence.                                                                   |

================

This section provides a formal denotational semantics for the primitive       |
expressions of Scheme and selected built-in procedures.  The concepts         |
and notation used here are described in [STOY77].                             |

     _Note:_ The formal semantics section was written in LaTeX which is       |
     incompatible with TeXinfo.  See the Formal semantics section:            |

This section gives macro definitions for the derived expression types in      |
terms of the primitive expression types (literal, variable, call,             |
`lambda', `if', `set!').  See section *Note Control features:: for a          |

The following `letrec' macro uses the symbol `<undefined>' in place of        |
an expression which returns something that when stored in a location          |
makes it an error to try to obtain the value stored in the location (no       |
such expression is defined in Scheme).  A trick is used to generate the       |
temporary names needed to avoid specifying the order in which the             |
values are evaluated.  This could also be accomplished by using an            |
auxiliary macro.                                                              |

The following definition of `do' uses a trick to expand the variable          |
clauses.  As with `letrec' above, an auxiliary macro would also work.         |
The expression `(if #f #f)' is used to obtain an unspecific value.            |

This section enumerates the changes that have been made to Scheme since       |
the "Revised^4 report" [R4RS] was published.                                  |

   * The report is now a superset of the IEEE standard for Scheme             |
     [IEEEScheme]: implementations that conform to the report will also       |
     conform to the standard.  This required the following changes:           |

        * The empty list is now required to count as true.                    |

        * The classification of features as essential or inessential          |
          has been removed.  There are now three classes of built-in          |
          procedures: primitive, library, and optional.  The optional         |
          procedures are `load', `with-input-from-file',                      |
          `with-output-to-file', `transcript-on', `transcript-off', and       |
          `interaction-environment', and `-' and `/' with more than two       |
          arguments.  None of these are in the IEEE standard.                 |

        * Programs are allowed to redefine built-in procedures.  Doing        |
          so will not change the behavior of other built-in procedures.       |
                                                                              |

   * _Port_ has been added to the list of disjoint types.                     |

   * The macro appendix has been removed.  High-level macros are now          |
     part of the main body of the report.  The rewrite rules for              |
     derived expressions have been replaced with macro definitions.           |
     There are no reserved identifiers.                                       |

   * `Syntax-rules' now allows vector patterns.                               |

   * Multiple-value returns, `eval', and `dynamic-wind' have been added.      |

   * The calls that are required to be implemented in a properly              |
     tail-recursive fashion are defined explicitly.                           |

   * ``@'' can be used within identifiers. ``|'' is reserved for              |
     possible future extensions.                                              |

The parameter system-derivative is a function that takes a system state       |
(a vector of values for the state variables y_1, ..., y_n) and produces       |
a system derivative (the values y_1^^, ...,y_n^^).  The parameter             |
initial-state provides an initial system state, and h is an initial           |
guess for the length of the integration step.                                 |

`Runge-Kutta-4' takes a function, f, that produces a system derivative        |
from a system state.  `Runge-Kutta-4' produces a function that takes a        |
